While the dish's general recipe is well known, the actual flavor can vary from restaurant to restaurant even within Delhi.\n",
        "Ingredients": "400-500 g of skinless, boneless chicken thighs or breasts (with the bone, this will probably be 800 g)\n50 g tandoori masala powder\n 1/2 cup of unsweetened yoghurt\n1 small lemon or lime, juiced\n2 tablespoons of butter\n1 large onion, sliced finely\n 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon (optional)\n2-3 cloves of crushed garlic\n2 teaspoons of grated ginger\n1 teaspoon of ground turmeric\n1 tablespoon of ground coriander\n2-3 teaspoons of chile powder\n100-200 g tomato paste\n100 g full cream",
        "Procedure": "Trim and cut the chicken into small cubes. If you prefer chicken on the bone, cut long thin slices laterally into the chicken.\nIn a big bowl combine the tandoori powder, yogurt, lemon juice, and chicken. Massage this well with your hands so that all the chicken is evenly covered in the Tandoori powder. Cover and put aside for at least  1/2 an hour.\nHeat a large saucepan or frying pan until evenly hot.\nIn the pan melt 2 tablespoons of butter until it is frothy. Add the onions and the cinnamon to the pan and fry lightly. When the onions are soft and starting to brown, stir in the crushed garlic and ginger. Then add the turmeric, chili, and coriander, and saute over a medium heat.\nAdd the chicken and saute, stirring constantly until the chicken has turned white. This doesn't take long, so make sure you don't overcook the chicken.\nMix in the tomato paste. Add the cream and heat through. After adding the cream and stirring, you may add additional tandoori masala. About 3-5 tablespoons is generally sufficient.\nCover and simmer for just over 10 minutes."

        "url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Irish_Stew",
        "desc": "Irish stew (Irish: stobhach gaelach) is a traditional Irish dish made from lamb or mutton as well as potatoes, onions and parsley. It originated in Ireland but appears in cookbooks all over Europe, including in Escoffier's Guide Culinaire. Although traditionally made with lamb or mutton, Irish stew was basically a cheap meal which was thrown together with left-overs and filled out with potatoes. Sometimes, lamb or mutton neckbones, shanks, and other trimmings were the only basis for the stock. Yet these would-be discards still held enough flavor after a long simmering process to do justice to a hearty bowl of stew. The root vegetables added further flavor and thickening power, as well as filling sustenance. Some cooks added turnips or parsnips, carrots, and barley when available.\n",
        "Ingredients": "2 1/2 lb (1.1 kg) deboned mutton, cut in chunks\n4 large potatoes, peeled and thickly sliced\n2 large onions, thickly sliced\n3-4 medium carrots, peeled and thickly sliced\n1 sprig of parsley, chopped\n2 cups (480 ml) water\nSalt\nPepper",
        "Procedure": "Choose a pot with a well-fitting lid and put in the ingredients in layers, starting and finishing with potatoes. Pour in the water and season to taste.\nCover and put on a very low heat for about 2 1/2 hours until the meat is tender and the potatoes have thickened the liquid.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The dish may also be made with lamb, in which case it requires only 1 1/2 hours cooking time."

        "desc": "Baati is a hard, unleavened bread cooked in desert areas of Rajasthan, Malwa, and Gujarat in North India. It is prized there for its exceptionally long life and high energy content, as well as the minimal quantity of water required in its preparation.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1 pound (450 g) wheat flour\n 1/2 teaspoon salt\n3 tablespoons oil\nWater\n1  1/2 teaspoons ghee (for serving)",
        "Procedure": "Mix the flour and salt.\nPut about 1 cup of flour mixture in a small bowl and add a little oil, mixing it in well and breaking up any lumps.\nAdd water about 1 tablespoon at a time and keep kneading with your hands. You only need 3-4 tablespoons, but you must knead the dough very hard to make it stick together in a ball. The more compact the dough, the better and denser the baati will be.\nLet the balls sit for 5 minutes.\nFlatten out each ball with first your hands and then a rolling pin until they are smooth discs 4 inches (10 cm) across and  1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.\nCook in a dry metal pan on a low flame. Flip once when the bottom begins to harden, then pinch all over with two fingers so the dough is not too thick and has a bumpy texture on one side.\nCheck the bottom until it browns in spots, then remove the baati and place it upside-down on a grate or pan with holes in it. This will blacken the top a little, especially on the tops of the pinched bumps.\nTo serve, drizzle liberally with ghee and accompany with a dhal or vegetable.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Sprinkle powdered sugar on after the ghee for a sweet snack."
