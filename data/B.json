Finally, add ground lemon peel.\nKnead it until you get nice, smooth dough.\nUse a cloth to cover the bowl.

Roll the dough to 1 cm thickness. Divide it so that you get equal squares of about 4 x 4 square centimeters each.\nTop each square with a dollop of jam. Pinch together the 4 corners of the square to enclose the filling, then roll the bun in your hands to round it out.\nPlace the buns side-by-side in the greased pan.

Pinch defined as 1/16 tsp.  Lemon was ambiguous, procedure texts suggests it and parenthetical means 1 lemon peel only, 1 lemon presumed to have 2 tsp of peel (minus pith).  Milk, jam, and pan oil amounts unknown.\n\n| Volumetric values are approximate, and were calculated from USDA National Nutrient Database data. To conserve column space, tablespoons were abbreviated as \"T\", and teaspoons as \"t\". \n\n| This excessive amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.75% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1% active dry yeast, although you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions will reduce yeast flavor even more, and those same reductions will result in longer times to rise during bulk ferment.\n\n| A typical water amount would be 50-70% (based on flour weight), likely 57-62% depending on protein of flour, so 60% is a single average figure to work with.  Eggs are 76% water, so 20% * 76% = 15.2%, which is the amount of water eggs have contributed.  Butter is about 16% water, so 24% * 16% = 3.84%, or about 4%. 60% - 15% - 4% = 41%. Whole milk is about 88% water.  41% / 88%  46.59%.  Thus, baker's % whole milk value should be somewhere around the value of 47%. Values to try would be in the approximate range of 37-57%."

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "For the best results, refrigerate the brownies until they are cooled completely. Use the foil hanging over the edges as handles to remove the baked brownies from the pan (this requires some care as the brownies are not solid at this point). Fold the foil over the top so that the brownies are covered top and bottom with foil, and then put the whole thing in the refrigerator until cooled (feel the bottom center if you aren't sure). This prevents the edges from overcooking while allowing the center to finish baking and cool. If you omit this step, you may end up with an undercooked center and/or overcooked edges.\nFor the real chocolate lover, crumble about 50 grams (1 3/4 ounces) of a dark chocolate bar (one with about 70% cocoa content) into the batter and stir it lightly right before pouring the mixture into the baking pan. You may need to add a few minutes to the baking time.\nCut a brownie in half lengthwise and eat it with ice cream in the middle like an ice cream sandwich.\nInstead of adding vanilla and/or nuts, try adding about 100 grams (4 oz) of fresh raspberries; their sharpness goes very well with the richness of the chocolate. Half fill the tin with batter, sprinkle the raspberries over the mixture, then pour on the rest."

Most likely, the method of slowly simmering beef in wine originated as a means of tenderizing cuts of meat that were too tough to cook any other way. Also, simmering these two ingredients together helps to create a unique and pleasant flavor.\n",

Cook a few minutes longer.\nAdd 1-2 cups of red wine.\nBring wine to a boil then simmer for 5 minutes.\nAdd beef, carrots, herbs, and mushrooms.\nAdd another couple cups of red wine and water (enough to cover the meat and vegetables).\nCook for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove surface scum as required.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Use leftovers to make meat pies or puff pastries.\nAdd a small amount of dried Trompettes de la mort (Craterellus cornucopioides). For a dish serving 4, 4 trompettes can be used depending on taste. Cut off parts that may contain sand, rinse, cut in small pieces, soak for 5 minutes in warm water and add to the dish after adding the wine. Can be used instead of garlic.\nUse a low-fat cut of beef and serve with boiled potatoes or steamed rice on the side to lower the fat and calories of this dish.",

        "desc": "Here is a recipe for a fantastic beef and Guinness casserole. You can find many variations of this by searching the internet, but I found many of them lacking so I experimented and experimented. Finally it started tasting deep and rich. Serves four (or three if you're my family---they can't get enough!).\n",
        "Ingredients": "Casserole\n1 kg (2.5 lbs) of round beef\n4-5 medium onions\n4-5 stalks of celery\n4-5 medium carrots\n1 bottle (500 ml) Guinness or other stout\n500 ml (16 oz) of tomato sauce (can use canned chopped tomato, but for a richer sauce use bottles of tomato sauce. Do NOT use ketchup!)\n1 small handful of fresh thyme\n2 cloves of garlic, crushed and sliced thin\n2 bay leaves\n 1/4 cup of plain flour\n2 tablespoons of peppercorns (can add more to taste)\n1 teaspoon of salt\nApproximately 1 litre (1 quart) of stock\nOlive oil\nChamp\n1 bunch of spring onion\nStarchy white potatoes (enough for 4 people)\nButter\nMilk",
        "Procedure": "Trim the meat of excess fat, and cut into 1-inch pieces.\nCut your vegetables into small, similarly sized pieces. Keep the carrots big enough (about  1/2-inch cuts), and none so big as you wouldn't want to find it later and think \"that's a bloody big bit of carrot\".\nFreshly grind your pepper to a fine powder in a pestle and mortar. Take your time with this. Then add a teaspoon of salt, and set half of this aside for your champ potato. Then add the other half to the  1/4 cup of flour and mix well to get seasoned flour. Then mix this in a big bowl with your beef.\nHeat your frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a good lug of olive oil, then add your coated beef (discard the excess coating, which shouldn't be much). You need enough oil so that the coating isn't dry on the beef. You then want to brown the beef--keep it moving so it doesn't burn. What you're doing is sealing the meat so it's tender and undergoing the Mailliard reaction, which give fantastic flavour. Brown in batches if pan is not very large. Put to one side.\nAdd another small glug of olive oil to the pan. Add the onion and turn to medium-low heat. Cook for a few minutes, add celery and garlic, and continue to cook until they all soften and the onion has started going golden. Add the carrot and continue for another few minutes.\nNow get a big oven-proof casserole dish, and add your stock, cooked vegetables, beef, Guinness, tomato, bay leaves and thyme. Bring to boil on a hob, put on the lid, and put into a preheated oven at 150degC (300degF) convection. Check every 40 minutes to 1 hour, and give a good stir. This takes 3 hours to cook properly. All the protein that makes round beef tough comes out into your sauce to make it thick and rich and your beef juicy and tender. If you did the browning part right, the beef should be succulent and bursting with flavour--if not then it is dry and boring.\nAbout 40 minutes before the casserole is done, boil the potatoes until soft. Drain, and allow to steam until dry. Mash thoroughly and add pepper/salt combo (salt to taste), butter, and a little milk--its amazing how little milk will turn your potato to sludge, so be careful. Once all this is mashed well, stir in your spring onion.\nServe in deep bowls. Put a layer of champ at the bottom, ladle your beef and Guinness on the top, serve, and enjoy."

        "desc": "To prepare this curry, you make a sauce from vegetables and spices first, then add the meat and stew it. The sauce is then thickened with yoghurt, and the sweetness of the curry is balanced with a little sour lime juice.\n",
        "Ingredients": "4-6 medium tomatoes\n1 medium onion\n4 tbsp vegetable oil\n3 cm (1-inch) piece ginger root\n2 garlic cloves\n1-2 mild green chillies\n1 tsp ground coriander\n1 tsp ground cumin\n 1/4 tsp ground turmeric\nSalt\nFreshly-ground black pepper\n100 ml (3 1/2 fl oz) water\n1 free-range chicken, jointed into 8 pieces, or 8 thighs and/or drumsticks\n2 tbsp yoghurt\n1 lime (or lemon)\n1 small bunch of coriander leaves\nCooked rice, to serve",
        "Procedure": "To skin the tomatoes, nick the skin of each tomato with the point of a sharp knife, then put the tomatoes in a bowl next to the sink and pour over some very hot water from the kettle to cover. Count to 20, then carefully pour away the water. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, peel away the skin, halve the tomatoes, squeeze out most of the pips and juice into an empty bowl, and discard. Chop the flesh roughly and put it down on a plate to one side.\nPeel and finely chop the onion. Fry the onion in the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over low to medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time so that it turns an even golden brown. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn't burn.\nMeanwhile, peel and finely chop the ginger and the garlic.\nSlit the chilli using a sharp knife. Slice the flesh away from the cluster of seeds in the middle. Avoid touching any part of the chilli with your fingers if you can, as it is very easy to get chilli in your eyes, and that will sting. You can use a fork to hold the chilli down or wear rubber gloves. Chop the chilli finely.\nMeasure the ground spices into a teacup. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli to the pan, stir them around and fry for another minute or so. If you want your curry to be hot as well as spicy, include some or all of the chilli seeds. Then add the spices in the cup into the onions. Fry the spices for a minute or two, stirring all the time so that they do not stick. Add some salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nPour in the water and the tomatoes, bring to the boil, turn down the heat a little and let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes.\nAdd the chicken pieces to the pan and stir them around so they are covered with the sauce. Put the lid on the pan, turn the heat down and let the chicken cook for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Chicken thighs will take longer to cook than breast pieces.\nNow add the yoghurt to the chicken and stir it in. When the sauce is gently bubbling again, scoop up a little in a teaspoon, blow it cool and taste it. The sauce will probably taste quite sweet because of the tomatoes. Cut the lime in half and squeeze its juice into the sauce. Stir and taste again, and decide whether you want to add the second half.\nFinally, chop the fresh coriander leaves and sprinkle them on to the curry just before you serve it with the rice."

        "desc": "A baozi, also known as bao or bau, is a type of steamed, filled bun or\nbread-like item in Chinese cuisine. In its bun-like aspect it is very similar to the traditional Chinese mantou, but baozi has filling. It can be filled with meat or vegetarian fillings, and used as an alternative to rice or noodles. It can be eaten at any meal in Chinese culture, and is often eaten for breakfast.\n",
        "Ingredients": "Ingredient\n\nCount\n\nVolume\n[note 1]\n\n\nWeight\n\nBaker's %\n\n\nWarm water (around body temperature-100degF or 38degC)\n\n\n\n200-250 ml (1 cup)\n\n198-248 g\n\n44-55%\n\n\nActive dry yeast [note 2]\n\n1 packet\n\n3 tsp\n\n7.2-12 g\n\n\n\n\nGranulated white sugar\n\n\n\n2 tbsp\n\n25.2 g\n\n5.60%\n\n\nWhite bread flour, plus extra for flouring hands, surfaces, etc.\n\n\n\n3  1/2 cups\n\n450 g\n\n100%\n\n\nDouble-acting baking powder\n\n\n\n1 tsp\n\n4.6 g\n\n1.02%\n\n\nSalt (optional)\n\n\n\n 1/2 tsp\n\n3 g\n\n0.67%\n\n\nSesame oil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilling, as desired (see notes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n688-743 g\n\n153-165%",
        "Procedure": "Dough\nStir yeast and 1 tablespoon of sugar into 1 cup of the warm water. Let stand for 15 minutes. Skip this step if your yeast does not need proofing (it will say so on the packet).\nSift the flour and sugar together.\nIf you pre-mixed the yeast, add to the flour and the rest of the sugar in a mixing bowl.\nIf you didn't pre-mix the yeast, mix flour, salt if desired, and the sugar, then mix in yeast in a mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of the water in a steady stream, mixing constantly.\nMix together. The dough will begin to form a ragged clump. If the dough does not stick together, add a small amount more water.\nKnead dough for 5-10 minutes. The dough will stiffen, and should spring back slowly when indented with a finger. The surface should be smooth and slightly shiny.\nCoat the bottom of a large bowl with the sesame oil to give a thin film, and place the dough in the bowl. Roll over so it is coated with the oil.\nAllow dough to rise and double in volume in a warm place for 1-1 1/2 hours, or in a cool place like a fridge for 2-3 hours. A slow rise in a cool place will produce a finer texture.\nPunch dough down. If you wish at this point, you can allow it to rise and double again, in a warm or cool place, and punch down again. A double rise also results in a finer, more tender texture.\nForm into a large pancake shape.\nSprinkle the baking powder evenly across the dough, and knead again, until the same consistency as before it rose. Water from the yeast's respiration may have made the dough softer, so add a bit more flour if needed.\nDivide the dough into two long rolls, and cut each into 6 pieces.\nRoll each piece of dough into a ball. If you are making plain baozi, go straight to Step 20 now. If making filled baozi, then flatten each ball into a 6-inch (15 cm) disc.\nShape the disc so that it is significantly thicker in the centre than at the edges.\nPosition one hand as if you were holding a normal drinking glass, and place a disc of dough over the top.\nUsing two fingers, push the centre of the disc down by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).\nPlace 1 dessert spoon of filling into the well you just made in the dough.\nStill holding your hand in position, use your other hand to fold the edges of the dough together, in a sort of pleated fashion.\nPinch edges together and twist (so that you twist a small portion at the top right off) to close the baozi.\nPlace each baozi on a square of parchment paper, 3 inches (7.5 cm) to a side.\nAllow to rise in warm place 1 hour. The dough should end up springy to the touch.\nCooking\nPlace buns in a steamer. Try to position so they do not touch one another. It will almost certainly require several batches to steam all the buns, unless you have lots of steamers, or a very big one. You can put them seam up (opening flower effect) or seam down (smooth, round top).\nSteam buns over gently boiling water for 10-15 minutes.\nAfter this time, remove the pan and steamer from heat, but don't remove the steamer from the pan, or lift the lid of the steamer. By allowing the steam to subside gradually like this, you prevent the dough from collapsing on contact with the cold air.\nAfter a few minutes, carefully lift the lid and remove the bun gently from the steamer.\nWhen cool enough to handle, remove parchment paper from bottom of buns.\nServe warm.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Use bleached flour for a whiter bread.\nThe ideal sweetness of the baozi is subjective - in China, they generally get sweeter the further south you go. This recipe is fairly sweet, but can be modified either way.\nDepending on taste, you can add salt to the dough -  1/2 tsp. should be sufficient. Remember not to allow concentrated salt to come into contact with the yeast, as it will kill it. Mix the salt with the flour, then add the yeast.\nEnsure the place used for rising is draft-free. Drafts prevent the dough from rising as much, resulting in a flatter bread.\nUse flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands, not oil. This keeps the dough from getting too wet. It is cooked in a damp environment, so you don't want wet dough.\nTry to keep the dough from drying out and forming a crust when not being worked with. Rise in a covered container (using clingfilm), and cover with a towel when not immediately handling the dough.\nAdd a couple of tablespoons of vinegar to the steaming water to bleach the buns slightly. The vinegar does not significantly affect the taste of the buns.\nTry to use a bamboo steamer. Although a metal one will suffice, it doesn't impart a subtle flavour to the buns like bamboo, and it won't prevent water from forming on flat surfaces and making soggy patches.\nCommon baozi fillings\nChar Siu - Chinese honey roast pork (cha shao, char siu or sometimes \"Chinese BBQ\")\nRed Bean Paste - A sweet paste made of azuki beans and sugar\nJiu Cai (simplified: Jiu Cai , Pinyin: jiu3 cai4) - Chinese chives\nLuobosi (simplified: Luo Bu Si , Pinyin: luo2bo si1) - Thinly sliced radish\nXiaolong Bao (Xiao Long Bao ) - \"Little dragon\" dumplings, one of the most famous fillings, usually soupy with spicy pork. Highly variable depending on region.",
        "Warnings": "Keep leftovers refrigerated.\nTo reheat, steam for 10-15 minutes or heat in microwave for 30-45 seconds. Reheating by steaming gives better results.",
        "Conversion notes": "| Weight conversions from USDA National Nutrient Database. Original recipe text and ingredient order preserved. Water density adjustment for 38degC applied.\n\n| This excessive amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.775% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1.05% active dry yeast, although in all cases you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions will result in less yeast flavor and longer bulk fermentation times."

When set, add some more quince or apple sauce (heated) on the top with some chopped almonds and serve hot. When starting with fresh fruit, stew it (optionally, with sugar to taste), flavoring with the rind of a half lemon, and pass it through a sieve, or use a food processor. The resulting puree can be decorated with some thin lemon peel cut into stars."
