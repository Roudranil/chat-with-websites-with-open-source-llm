        "desc": "Nachynka in Ukrainian literally means stuffing. This dish is usually not stuffed inside anything, but served as a side dish.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1/2 cup (125 g / 4.4 oz) butter\n1 cup (140 g / 4.9 oz) cornmeal\n3 cups (750 ml / 1.6 pints) homogenized milk\n2 large eggs\n1 tsp salt\n 1/2 tsp sugar\n1 tsp baking powder\nButter",
        "Procedure": "Preheat oven to 350degF (175degC).\nMelt butter in a pot on medium heat.\nAdd cornmeal. Stir mixture to warm up the cornmeal.\nAdd milk. Stir until mixture has thickened.\nBeat eggs. Beat in salt, sugar, and baking powder.\nSlowly add some of the thickened cornmeal mixture to the egg mixture while mixing to temper the eggs.\nStir the egg mixture into the rest of the cornmeal.\nPour the mixture into a greased casserole dish.\nBake at 350degF (175degC) for 30-40 minutes or until the top has browned.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "While you are thickening the cornmeal mixture, you have enough time to beat the eggs.\nDoubling the recipe will yield enough to fill a 2 litre casserole dish.\nFor different flavour variations:\nMix in a  1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.\nChop up a small onion and cook till tender in the butter, before adding cornmeal.",
        "Warnings": "Do not add the egg mixture to the cornmeal. Some of the eggs will cook on impact resulting in streaks of cooked eggs and a heavier Nachynka."
