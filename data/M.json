        "desc": "Moin moin, also called moimoi or moyin moyin, is a traditional West African (particularly Nigerian) dish based on black-eyed peas or other beans. It is usually conical or cylindrical in shape, depending on the type of mould used. Some use small baking tins as the mould, while others use light transparent nylon bags. Traditionally, however, the moin-moin is wrapped in leaves of the Yoruba soft cane (Thaumatococcus daniellii). The leaves give the dish a sweetish aftertaste.\n",
        "Ingredients": "About 2 milk tins of black-eyed peas, or other beans\nWater\nBell peppers, diced\nScotch bonnet chile peppers, diced\nOnion, diced\nAbout 2-3 tbsp palm or vegetable oil\nSalt to taste\nSeasoning cubes to taste\nHard-boiled eggs (optional), cut in quarters\nDried or fresh fish (optional)\nBeef (optional), in chunks or minced\nLiver (optional)",
        "Equipment": "Oven\nGrinding machine\nPot\nSpoon\nBowl",
        "Procedure": "Traditionally, moin moin is steamed rather than baked. Steaming is the most common method used to cook moin moin and is considered the traditional way of preparing the dish. However, some people have adapted the recipe and started baking moin moin instead of steaming it. Baking moin moin gives it a slightly different texture and flavour compared to steaming. Baking can make the moin moin denser and drier than the steamed version. Both methods are covered below.\nSteamed\nPlace the beans in a large container. Cover them with water, and soak for about 1 hour.\nBlend all the peppers with the onion to make a smooth paste.\nPrepare foil or empty cans as molds for cooking.\nIf using empty cans, make sure their interior is clean, and lightly greased.\nIf using foil:\nTear off about 1 foot (30 cm) of the foil.\nFold the foil in half.\nOne of the edges is closed and fine. For two of the other edges, roll them a few times over to make sure they will take the weight of the mixture (at least an inch-worth of rolling).\nWhen you are done, the foil will look like rectangles with only one edge open.\nRub the beans between your hands to peel the skin off. The skin should float to the top of the container. Keep doing this until you have most of the skin off the beans.\nGrind the beans into a smooth, finely-ground, mostly-liquid paste.\nAdd blended mix of scotch bonnet peppers, bell peppers and onions, a few teaspoons of oil, a little salt, and the optional ingredients as desired.\nTransfer the mixture into the intended mould:\nIf using cans, simply pour some of the batter into the cans, making sure you leave enough room for the moin moin to expand.\nIf using foil, pour some of the batter into the foil, and then close up the last edge of the foil by rolling it securely.\nIf using the leaves, wrap the leaves into an open cone. Fold the bottom of the cone to prevent the mix from leaking out. Place some of the mixture to fill half the cone. Roll the top of the cone and fold it. Place the cone in such a way as to keep the folded portion flat against the cooking surface, which should also be lined with the leaves.\nBring water to boil in a large pot. The water should at least cover the bottom of the pot. Less water is needed if you use the leaves. Add the filled moin moin molds.\nLeave the moin moin to steam for at least 30 minutes until it solidifies.\nRemove them from the cans or the foil before serving.\nServe with rice, meat, custard, pap or other side dishes as desired.\nBaking\nGrind the peeled beans alongside the pepper and onion to give a smooth paste.\nAdd grounded Maggi, salt, and vegetable oil to the paste, and stir with a wooden spoon to make the ingredients uniform.\nPreheat oven to 200degC (390degF).\nRub vegetable oil in the muffin cups and pour the moi moi mixture inside.\nFold aluminum foil to the sides of the up to prevent the moi moi from drying up.\nPour water in an oven tray and place the muffin cups in the tray\nBake for 45 minutes, replenishing the water as necessary to prevent it from drying up.\nLeave to cool down and remove from oven when done.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Some people recommend lightly grinding the beans before soaking them to make it easier to remove the skin.\nSome variants of this dish call for minimal or no removal of the beans' skins. The resulting moin moin is thicker than usual, and somewhat harder to digest."

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The tiniest bit of egg yolk or fat prevents the egg white to get stiff.\nMeringues are more decorative if shaped with a pastry bag.\nAnother method of baking is to preheat the oven and bake the meringues 2-3 minutes at moderately hot temperature, then turn down the oven completely and keep it shut for 8 hours.\nMeringues do not turn out very well, if the air is very humid (due to climate or due to steam from other cooking).\nIn the original Swiss recipe, two meringues per serving are filled with sweetened whipped cream, but the cream is often supplemented with strawberries or other fresh fruits and vanilla ice cream."

Only then add the milk to the mix. This can speed up the process without affecting the flavor. This method is often used by restaurants to serve chai in large quantities quickly as orders are taken.\nOptionally turn off the heat in the end, cover, and let sit for about 5 minutes for a richer flavor.\nTry adjusting the ratio of milk to water. For a richer milky tea, try two parts milk to one part water.\nLeave out the sugar for a more adult flavor. Sugar can be added while drinking if so desired.\nTry other combinations of South Asian spices. Each region in which chai is commonly available has its own popular or traditional spice mix. One optional addition to masala chai is fennel seeds.\nAdd a piece of a lemongrass leaf (called lili cha in Gujarati), while the water is still boiling (before adding milk). This gives a nice flavor to the tea. Mint, fresh ginger, and/or holy basil (tulsi) can also be added.\nTo make ground ginger: Select good quality ginger and wash to remove soils and other foreign objects. Cut into thin slices. Spread evenly in trays. Dry under the sun or in oven under moderate heat or (70oC). Pulverize using blender or grinder. Pack and seal tightly."

        "Ingredients": "4 salmon steaks or individual fillets (preferably wild-caught)\n4 tbsp (60 ml) fresh lemon juice, divided\n2 tsp (10 ml) pure maple syrup\n2 tbsp (30 ml) grapeseed oil (or other neutral oil)\n1 1/2 tsp (7 g) chipotle powder (chipotle barbecue sauce may be substituted for this)\n1 tsp (5 g) crushed dried rosemary\n2 scallions, thinly sliced for garnish\nSalt",
        "Special equipment": "Cedar plank(s) large enough to hold salmon without crowding (these must be untreated cedar planks with no preservatives or chemicals)\nGrill\nSpray bottle of water for controlling flare-ups",
        "Procedure": "Completely immerse cedar planks in water for several hours or overnight.\nHeat grill to medium-high.\nMix 2 tablespoons (30 ml) lemon juice, the oil, rosemary, maple syrup, and half of the chipotle powder in a small bowl. Coat the salmon with the mixture and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.\nMix the remaining lemon juice with the remaining chipotle powder with a fork and set aside as a garnish.\nPlace plank(s) on grill and close lid. Allow plank to heat for a couple minutes.\nLightly sprinkle salt on plank(s).\nPut salmon on plank, keeping fish at least an inch from the edge of the plank (in the case of fillets, place skin-side down). Reduce heat to low and close lid.\nGrill for roughly 15 minutes without turning or moving salmon until desired \"doneness\" is reached. Generally, salmon should be cooked until the flesh loses its transparency and the meat can easily be broken with a fork. Spray with water to douse any flames that light on the sides of the plank.\nWhen cooked, place the salmon on a serving platter and sprinkle with the scallions.\nImmerse the cedar plank in water as a safety precaution.\nServe the salmon with the optional lemon juice/chipotle sauce."

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "In Madeira these honey cakes are made on 8 December, which is traditionally considered the day of Mary's Immaculate Conception, because tradition says this cake is only good for Christmas if it is made on this day.\nIt is a custom to make enough of this cake in order to have some during the whole year. Once cooled and thoroughly wrapped into vegetable paper it remains good until next Christmas without losing quality or taste.\nAnother tradition surrounding this cake is that it is not cut with knives, but by hand, and also eaten by hand, nothing more than a tradition but very respected among Madeira locals.\nFennel is often used instead of anise. Raisins are sometimes added.",
