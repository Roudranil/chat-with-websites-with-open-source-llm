    "Cookbook:Traditional Pilau Rice": {
        "url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Traditional_Pilau_Rice",
        "desc": "Known as pilau, pullao, pulao and pilaf, this rice dish will take between up to an hour to prepare if made the traditional way. The cooking time can be reduced with various ingredient compromises, like using ready-fried onions instead of caramelizing the onion yourself, and using quorn mince rather than taking the time to brown lamb mince. Many Indians are vegetarian, and meat is not necessary for this dish; omitting the mince and just using chickpeas for the protein, or substituting imitation ground meat will make the recipe vegan or vegetarian.\n",
        "Ingredients": "425 ml basmati rice\n1 medium onion or  1/2 large onion, peeled and finely chopped\n1-2 cloves of garlic\nGaram masala spice mixture\n1 tsp ground cumin\n1 1/2 tsp ground coriander\n250 g minced meat (lamb or mutton are most common, but you could use beef or imitation meat).\n400 g tinned chickpeas (240 g drained weight)\n1 large tomato, diced, or 1 dozen cherry tomatoes, cut into eighths\nFrozen petits pois (optional)\nSalt\nOil (use sunflower oil or a similar vegetable oil without a strong taste) or ghee\n575 ml water",
        "Procedure": "Wash the rice in several changes of water and leave it to soak while you prepare the other ingredients, changing the water whenever you have a spare moment.\nChop the onion, and heat the oil or ghee in the saucepan. Add the onion to the pan and fry over a very low heat until caramelized, stirring frequently to prevent them burning. The onions must be browned, not translucent, to get the authentic flavour. This will take at least 15 minutes. If you want to save time, you can do as many Pakistani cooks do and use the ready-fried onions that can be bought in large bags in Asian supermarkets (or in small, expensive pots sold as \"crispy salad onions\" in English supermarkets). If using ready-fried onions, skip this step and add them when you add the water.\nWhile the onions are browning, prepare the other ingredients (not forgetting to stir the onions occasionally). Bash the garlic in a mortar and pestle with some salt, chop the tomatoes and drain the chickpeas.\nWhen the onions look like they are beginning to brown, add the garlic and any powdered or seed spices. Do not add them earlier than this or they will burn in the long time the onions take to caramelize.\nWhen the onions and garlic are both done, add the tomatoes and stir for a minute or so. This will help to deglaze the pan and seems to stop the onions cooking any more. Turn up the heat and add the mince. If using meat mince, cook until completely browned (5-10 minutes). If using quorn mince, you just need to cook for a couple of minutes until heated through.\nWhile the mince is cooking, drain the washed rice in a sieve and put a kettle of water on to boil. When the mince is cooked, add the drained rice to the pan, along with a little extra oil or ghee if necessary. Stir the rice gently until it is coated in the oil, taking care not to break up the grains.\nAdd 575 ml hot water, along with the drained chickpeas and any larger spices like bay leaves, cardamom pods or cloves. Add the salt and bring to the boil.\nOnce boiled, put on a tight-fitting lid and turn the heat to very low. Cook for 25 minutes and do not remove the lid.\nAfter 25 minutes, remove the lid, add the peas, cover with a clean teatowel (optional) and replace the lid. Turn off the heat and leave to rest for 5 minutes; the peas will cook in the residual heat and the teatowel will absorb excess moisture/condensation.\nTurn out onto a serving platter (separate large lumps by pressing with the back of a spoon) or plate up. Add any garnishes, and serve with yoghurt.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Basmati rice will produce the best flavour, but other long-grain rice can be used.\nA cast iron pan with a thick bottom will reduce the likelihood of the rice burning at the bottom. The saucepan you use should have a minimum of 20-22 cm diameter.\nWhether to serve this dish as a meal in itself or a side dish depends on the ingredients used. If you have used ingredients containing protein, like mince or chickpeas, it can be served as a meal in itself with perhaps just a side salad. If you omit most of the ingredients, it can serve as a plainer foil to a spicy dish.\nChopped chillies may be added and the frying stage, but if you are going to be eating the rice with curry you may prefer it plain.\nDried chickpeas are cheaper than tinned chickpeas but much less convenient--they must be soaked overnight and then cooked for a long time separately to the rice.\nOther ingredients, such as cubed potatoes (1-2 cm to a side), diced carrots or courgettes (zucchini) cut into matchsticks can be added when the water is added. Ingredients like diced mushrooms or cubes of aubergine (eggplant) (1-2 cm to a side) can be added at the frying stage.\nSliced reconstituted dried mushrooms are a non-traditional but tasty variant that can be added either during the frying stage or when the water is added. Use 6-8 dried mushrooms, remembering that their size will increase greatly when soaked. Large bags of shiitake-like dried mushrooms can be bought cheaply in Chinese supermarkets, and the soaking liquid from the mushrooms can be substituted for some of the water to give the rice a really rich, tasty flavour without using any meat (just make sure to either strain the liquid through cheesecloth or leave the last centimetre or so of liquid in the jug to avoid getting any grit that has been washed off the mushrooms in your rice).\nThe rice can be garnished with toasted flaked almonds when it is turned out onto a plate.\nPlease note that the amounts of rice needed is given by volume, not weight.\nThe rice should be well washed. Skipping the washing step will cause the rice to gum together because of the starch.\nBe careful to use the right proportions of water. If you use too much, the rice will be soggy, and if you use too little it may be hard in the middle. The rice should have absorbed all the water by the end of the cooking time; if you have to drain water off, you have used too much. If you are using a lot of wet ingredients, you may need to reduce the quantity of water used very slightly.\nDifferent rice varieties require different amounts of water, so if you wanted to make this recipe using brown rice instead of white basmati rice, you would need to change the amount of water.\nIf you are not using mince, you need less spices, and if you are using mince, you need more spices.\nQuorn mince can be cooked from frozen but meat mince must be defrosted.\nThe spice mixture can be bought pre-mixed from Asian supermarkets or you can make your own using cumin, coriander powder, powdered ginger, turmeric, nutmeg, cardamom, fennel seeds, pepper, cloves, bay leaves etc. At least a teaspoon of cumin and coriander is essential, but you can pick and choose which of the others you want to include, or use just a pinch or two of each of them.",

        "Equipment": "Container large enough to hold all of the sima (a big plastic bucket for example)\nEmpty bottles\nFunnel",
        "Procedure": "First day\nSterilize all of your equipment. A thorough process is described in the mead recipe. However, as the fermentation time of sima is very short (only a few days) and it is usually consumed within a week or so, just washing the bucket and bottles well and then rinsing them with boiling water right before using is generally enough to prevent spoiling.\nBoil 4 litres of water.\nWash the lemons well and peel the zest, being careful not to include the bitter white pith. Put the zest into your container.\nSlice the lemons and remove the white pith from around the slices. Add the slices into the container.\nAdd all the sugar into the container with the lemons.\nPour the boiling water on top, and mix well until the sugar is mostly dissolved.\nAdd 4 litres of cold water so that the mixture will be lukewarm, the right temperature for the yeast to activate. If unsure, check with a thermometer--the temperature should be between 35degC and 45degC.\nWhen the temperature is right, add the yeast. One way is to take a small cup of the mixture from the container, dissolve the yeast in it and then mix it back. Just dropping a crumb of fresh yeast into the container will also work.\nLet it stand overnight in room temperature.\nSecond day\nBottle it on the next day: add one spoonful of sugar and a few raisins to each bottle before you pour the sima in.\nAfter bottling, let the bottles stand at room temperature out of direct sunlight for 2 more days. The raisins will bloat up and float to the surface.\nMove the bottles to your refrigerator. The sima is ready, and should be served cold. It will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator.",
        "Notes, tips and variations": "For a simpler process, just squeeze in the juice of 1-2 lemons instead of removing the pith.\nYou may use 1 kg brown sugar instead of mixing white and brown to make a darker sima with a stronger brown sugar flavour.\nAll the sugar may optionally be replaced with 1 kg honey.\nYou can put the bottled sima into the refrigerator immediately instead of fermenting overnight at room temperature. This will cause the fermentation to be slower; the sima will be ready in approximately 5-7 days.\nPlastic soda bottles are recommended as pressure can build up in the bottles. An exploding plastic bottle is less dangerous than an exploding glass bottle.",

Boil in large pot for 15 minutes and make sure you barely cover the bones with the water.\nSkim off as much scum/foam as much possible as it forms.\nDrain in colander and use a brush to remove any bloody meat.\nUse a saw and cut halfway down the center of the bones. Then use hammer to break bone.\nThe bones will be filled with marrow. Simmer for several hours until the marrow dissolves out from the bones.\nScum will form at the start. Carefully skim the scum off. Maintain a low boil over medium heat.\nAfter scum has stopped forming, simmer for 6 hours or more. Add more water if the water level drops.\n2 hours after the pork bones have started simmering, the soup should become progressively white and cloudy. If tasted at this stage, the soup will not taste good since it will still have a raw flavor.\nAfter the soup has simmered for 6 hours, the inside of the bones should be empty and the soup should have a rich smell just like a ramen place.\nChashu\nBrown the meat in a pan and then simmer in a pot for 2 hours in a sauce made from the remaining ingredients. Allow to cool in the pot. The char siu should be a nice amber color. Slice with care since it will be very tender and tend to fall apart.\nNoodles\nMix the flour and kansui together, then add the water. It may feel as if the amount of water is insufficient--this is normal.\nMix in bowl until a mealy consistency is achieved. The dough will be very stiff. Use you body weight to form the dough into a ball.\nTransfer to kneading surface and knead. Knead vigorously for 10 minutes. It is okay if the dough cracks or does not knead together well.\nForm into ball, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Make sure that the dough does not dry out.\nAfter the dough has rested, roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5 mm and then insert into pasta machine. Start out with the highest thickness and then continue on the lower settings until the desired thickness is achieved. If a pasta machine is not used, roll out the dough to the desired thickness with the rolling pin. Take into account that the noodles will expand 1.3 times when boiled.\nThe dough will not be that sticky, so a small amount of flour or potato (or corn) starch is sufficient for flouring.\nA wooden box is best for storing the noodles, but if one is not available, use a metal tray lined with wax paper (to prevent sticking) and store in the refrigerator.\nAssembly\nBring a pot of water to a boil, and add the noodles. Cook the noodles to each person's preference, then drain. For people who like curly noodles, firmly squeeze the noodles until the desired effect is achieved.\nWarm a large soup bowl, and add the drained noodles. Add broth, then top with char siu and marinated egg. Add salt for flavor--use sparingly at first and then add more if desired.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Kansui is a Japanese mixture of alkaline salts. Try the Koon Chun brand, which comes in a clear glass bottle labeled \"potassium carbonate & sodium bi-carbonate solution\". The UPC is 0-20717-80230-8.\nAny leftover char siu can be eaten with beer. If you ever have trouble slicing soft pork, chill the whole piece in the refrigerator until cold, and it makes slicing easier. Reheating is easy, in either the microwave or oven, even stove top.\nMake sure you keep up on scooping out the foamy gunk from the broth--you don't want all that stuff all over your ramen.\nDon't be afraid to experiment with different types and balances of garnishes!"

        "Procedure": "If you would like to have 'build-your-own' tacos, dice the optional ingredients your desire as needed and place in separate bowls for use on the table.\nPlace the beef in a wide pan on a large burner. Ground beef will need to be broken up as it cooks; chopped or sliced beef needs to be stir-fried and may require oil. When using high-fat ground beef, you may wish to drain and very, very lightly rinse the beef in a colander, or add water to float the fat, cool to solidify the fat, remove the fat, drain the water, and reheat. If you are using ground beef, which is quite alright, also see the Taco Meat recipe.\nAdd lots of cumin to the beef. Cumin is the magic ingredient that makes a taco taste like a taco. You may also add a bit of salt, a bit of chili powder and/or diced onion.\nPrepare the outside covering:\nPre-made shells can be reheated in the microwave as the package directs.\nPlain corn tortillas can be used for soft tacos, although, for soft tacos, either a double layer of corn tortillas or a single layer of flour tortilla works best. The tortillas should be microwaved, covered, in 15+ second stages, flipping between stages, until warm, and kept covered and warm prior to use.\nYou could make your own hard taco shells from corn tortillas, but rest very well assured that soft corn tortilla tacos are absolutely the most traditional.  If you need hard shells and can not find them pre-made, you may, with great effort and use of your time, use a deep-fat process, going one at a time and using a large spoon to form the shells into the normal U shape. Pan frying in  1/4 inch to  1/2 inch of oil will also work; be sure not to let the tortillas stiffen prior to being bent into the U shape you desire.\nPlace hot beef into a hard shell or down the middle of a warm soft tortilla (two for corn). A very simple, and quite authentic, taco would be to then add a sprinkling of finely diced onion and cilantro into the inside of the taco, fold the tortilla over (if soft) and serve with lime quarters for squeezing into the taco. See Tacos de Bistec.\nYou may also continue on to place cheese onto the beef. The heat of the beef should slightly melt the cheese. You may wish to microwave the taco a bit, especially if the cheese is cold or if you are using low-fat cheese.\nAdd other toppings as the cook desires.\nServe the tacos with a small or large assortment of items that people can add. Traditionally, in a restaurant, this would amount to only pico de gallo or a hot sauce. However, 'build-your-own' tacos with a good assortment of items to add can add a bit of fun to a gathering or family dinner."
