        "Ingredients": "1/4 cup oil for frying\n1 tbsp sugar\n4 lbs (1.8 kg) chicken, cut in pieces\n 1/2 cup olives (pitted) or capers\n2 tbsp oil, for when rice is almost done\n 1/2 cup finely diced celery\n 1/2 cup finely diced onion\n2 cloves of garlic, chopped\n4 cups rice\n5 1/4 cups chicken stock or water\n 1/4 cup tomato paste\n1 tsp salt or to taste\n1 tsp thyme\n 1/2 tsp oregano (optional)\n1 tsp ground black pepper",
        "Procedure": "Stovetop method\nHeat the  1/4 cup oil in a pot over high heat.\nAdd the sugar to the pot. Let it melt and caramelize, turning light brown. Pay close attention and don't let the sugar burn. Do not use plastic utensils to stir the sugar, since it will be at around 350degF (175degC).\nAdd the meat to the caramel and let it brown on all sides. Remove and reserve the meat.\nAdd the garlic, onions, and celery to the pot. Fry.\nAdd rice and cooked meat to pot with the vegetables. Whisk together chicken stock and tomato paste until smooth, then stir it into the rice mixture. Stir in the salt, pepper, thyme, and olives.\nCheck the seasoning. If the salt level is good, add an extra  1/2 tsp of salt. This is because the rice will absorb some of the salt, and it will come out a bit flat in the end unless you add extra salt.\nBring to a boil over high heat. Let it boil, stirring occasionally, until the water is absorbed. The high heat is needed to bring the rice temperature up so that it cooks. If you lower the flame at this point, the rice might not cook all the way.\nCover, lower the heat, and let it cook for 15 minutes.\nUncover, sprinkle 2 Tbsp oil on top, and stir so that the uncooked rice on top goes to the bottom. Cook for another 5 minutes.\nIf rice still not cooked, give it another stir and cook for another 5 minutes. Sometimes you may need more time; see notes below.\nTurn heat on high for a couple of minutes to brown and toast the rice on bottom. Sometimes it does this by itself during the main cooking so you don't have to do this. Experience will tell.\nServe.\nOven method\nPreheat oven to 350degF (125degC).\nProceed with the recipe as above, using an oven-proof pot, until the rice absorbs all the liquid. Once this happens, cover the pot, put it in the oven, and bake for 30 minutes.\nAdd 2 tbsp oil, and stir so the uncooked rice is on the bottom and the bottom rice is on the top. Bake for another 20 minutes.\nStir. If it is still not fully cooked, bake another 20 minutes.\nServe.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "If the rice doesn't cook but all the water was absorbed, you can separate the rice from the meat, put it in a bowl, and give it 5 minutes on high in the microwave. Often there wasn't enough heat to cook the rice. On some stoves, once covered (as mentioned above), you may have to cook 20 minutes, add oil, stir, and cook another 20-40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.\nIt is also helpful to put a sheet or two of aluminium foil over the pot before putting the lid on. That helps seal the lid and keep the heat/steam from escaping, and the rice often comes out better.\nDominicans tend to cook the rice on the dry side--the rice will be cooked through, but not too watery. The ratio should be 4 cups rice to 5 1/2 cups liquid (some locrio recipes ask for 7-8 cups of liquid, which makes things mushy). If you have tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, you can use that also, as long as the ratios are the same (e.g. 1 cup tomato sauce to 4 1/2 cups water/stock; which makes a total of 5 1/2 cups liquid). If you halve the recipe, the ratio rice to liquid will be 2 cups rice to 2 3/4 cups liquid.\nSome people deep fry the meat separately, remove the excess oil, and then caramelize the sugar.\nThe ingredients of the sofrito vary, and can be made in advance. Some add cilantro, bell peppers, culantro, and other aromatics to it.\nOther vegetables such as 1 cup of cubed auyama squash are sometimes added with the rice.\nYou can also substitute guineafowl, rabbit, Dominican salami, pork chops, or other meat for the chicken. Almost any meat can be used, including cubed ham or spam, arrenque (smoked dried herring, pre-soaked in warm water to remove some salt, but cut the amount of salt you use), canned sardines, Vienna sausages, shellfish (mariscos) and if in desperation, ground beef, meatballs, hot dogs, etc. can also be used. You can use 2 lbs of chicken gizzards also, but gizzards need to be boiled (or pressure cooked) until tender first.\nSome people use Sazon Completo for the seasoning. Although it is not authentic, you can also add 1 tsp ajinomoto (Wei noSu ), which is similar.\nYou can take the skin off the chicken before frying it.\nInstead of chicken stock, some people throw in a stock cube."

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Cooking and shelling a fresh lobster can be a time consuming process, so frozen or pre-shelled tail meat is often used as a substitute. If you would like to prepare your own lobster meat, refer to the recipe for boiled lobster.\nWhile the base preparation of Lobster Thermidor often remains the same, the type of wine or cheese used, or the way that the lobster is cooked differs.\nSome preparations include utilizing the broth generated from cooking the lobster with carrots, celery, tarragon, and wine as an additional ingredient to thicken the sauce of cream and sherry.",

        "Procedure": "Pound the digestive biscuits into crumbs with the end of a rolling pin.\nAdd sufficient melted butter to the crumbs to make the mixture cohesive. Mix well, then press it into the bottom of a 10 inch (25 cm) diameter, 1 inch deep pie dish. Press down firmly with the tip of a spoon to make the base.\nCombine the sweetened condensed milk and egg yolk. Stir gently, then mix in the lemon zest and juice to taste--more will be better, but be careful not to add too much or it will spoil the texture. Do not stir too much.\nPour the filling into the pie dish, covering the biscuit layer.\nWhip the egg whites until foamy. Gradually beat in the sugar until you get stiff peaks.\nSpoon the meringue into the pie dish, sealing around the edges.\nBake in a moderately cool oven (325 degF / 162 degC) for about 45 minutes until the meringue is a light golden brown. The aim is to cook the meringue and partly cook the centre (unlike, say, Baked Alaska, where only the top of the meringue is flash-cooked).\nRemove from the oven, allow to cool, and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours to set.\nEnjoy.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "There are 2 types of lemon meringue pie. The more common version has a lemon \"gel\" in the centre (which is often a luminous yellow colour), and a hard pastry base. The version above is much stickier.\nIn an earlier version, the filling used 3 egg yolks. It isn't necessary.\nWhen making the middle, it's essential to mix in the egg before the lemon. The acidity of the lemon acts on the yolk protein to thicken it; putting in the lemon first (which is tempting if you want to \"add lemon to taste\" without eating raw egg yolk) will cause the yolk to go \"stringy\" on contact."

        "Procedure": "Pie crust\nPrepare and bake Grandma's Pie Crust or a ready-made refrigerated or frozen pie crust.\nLet cool.\nPie filling\nIn a saucepan whisk together water, sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt, turmeric, lemon juice and lemon zest. Make sure any flour or cornstarch lumps are stirred until they dissolve.\nCook over medium heat until mixture starts to simmer. Stir constantly.\nAdd butter, then stir until melted.\nBeat egg yolks in a small bowl. Add about  1/2 cup (120 g) of hot lemon mixture into eggs and stir well. This tempers the egg yolks so they won't scramble when added to the simmering lemon mixture.\nPour tempered egg mixture into pan of simmering lemon mixture. Stir until well mixed.\nContinue simmering lemon filling about 2 minutes until it thickens, stirring constantly.\nPour into cooled pie shell and allow to cool while preparing meringue.\nMeringue\nPlace 4 egg whites in mixer and whip at high speed until they start to foam.\nAdd cream of tartar to egg whites then, while continuing to beat, add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat about 30 seconds between tablespoonfuls of sugar.\nContinue to beat meringue until stiff peaks form when beaters are raised from bowl.\nSpread meringue over pie, starting on lemon pie filling, using rubber spatula. Spread over edges of crust, completely sealing in the lemon pie filling.\nTo form peaks in meringue, use the flat side of a rubber spatula to touch the meringue and pull away. Repeat over entire surface of meringue.\nPlace pie in 350degF (180degC) oven for 15 minutes until high points of meringue are lightly browned.\nServe at room temperature or chilled.",
        "Warnings": "The pie filling is quite hot when pouring it into pie shell.\nKeep this pie refrigerated.\nIn humid weather meringue may \"weep\" (small dots of liquid form on the surface). To lessen this possibility, apply meringue to lemon filling while it is still hot, cool pie to room temperature before refrigerating, and/or use powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar when making the meringue."

        "desc": "Lancashire parkin is a traditional cake eaten on Fifth of November in parts of Greater Manchester. Like many gingerbreads, it is baked into a hard slab. It then softens due to the hygroscopic properties of golden syrup.\n",
        "Ingredients": "340 g (1  1/2 cups / 12 oz) self-raising flour\n340 g (1  1/2 cups / 12 oz) oatmeal\n220 g (1 cup or 8 oz) caster sugar\n1 tbsp powdered ginger\n1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (optional)\n440 g (2 cups / 16 oz / 1 lb) tin golden syrup (Tate & Lyle's brand preferred)\n220 g (1 cup / 8 oz) hard margarine",
        "Procedure": "Preheat the oven to 150degC (300degF or gas mark 2).\nWarm the tin of golden syrup in a bowl of hot water.\nMix together all the dry ingredients.\nEmpty the golden syrup into a saucepan, and warm it gently without boiling. You can balance the tin over the pan by using two chopsticks.\nMelt the margarine into the syrup.\nUse the margarine wrapper to grease a 12-inch square baking tray (an 11x13 inch pan will also work). Line the tin with baking paper.\nMix the hot syrup and fat into the dry ingredients. Stir thoroughly but quickly.\nSpread the dough into the baking tray. Put it on the bottom shelf of the preheated oven, and bake for 2 hours.\nRemove from oven, and turn the slab out from the tray onto a cooling grid. After an hour, cut into four, and store in a sealed tin for 48 hours to reach correct consistency. It can be eaten while warm, but it is better if it is stored at least overnight.\nCut into long strips, getting between 8 and 12 slices from each quarter."
