        "desc": "A double hamburger is a variant on a sandwich involving a patty of ground meat, usually beef (known in the United Kingdom as a beefburger), or a vegetarian patty. A slice of cheese on the patty makes it a cheeseburger, a common variation in the United States.\n",
        "Ingredients": "500 g (1.1 lb) minced (ground) beef\nHerbs and spices (optional; see suggestions)\nCheese (optional; see suggestions)\nSalad (lettuce, spinach, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, onion etc; optional)\n1 hamburger bun per burger",
        "Procedure": "Remove the ground beef from the package and shape by hand into burgers. You should get 4-6 burgers from the listed quantity of beef.\nIf adding optional ingredients, either season the outside or mix into the beef before forming the patties. Overworking the beef will result in mushy meat that won't stick together, so only mix the minimum necessary and do so by hand.\nFry or grill the burgers for about 4-5 minutes on each side for burgers that aren't too thick.\nLet the burger rest for several minutes before serving to let the juices cool down and not burst out at first bite.\nEnsure your burgers are fully cooked through before serving. If your burgers are quite thick or if you are unsure, you can cut one open to ensure the insides are browned. If the insides are red, there is a chance that the meat is not fully cooked. Alternately, you can insert a meat thermometer into the center of the burger, if the temperature reads less than 71degC (160degF), your burger is undercooked.\nServe each burger on a bun (sesame seed usually), optionally with relish, sliced pickles, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, ranch dressing, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and/or onions.",
        "Notes, tips and variations": "Some suggestions for seasonings include garlic, onion flakes or a small onion, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, mustard, olive oil, cheese, butter and/or 2 tsp of your favorite hot sauce for some kick. The amounts of herbs and/or spices are up to your local taste and meat quality. Depending on the quality of your local beef, for example, you may wish to add some beef stock to improve the flavour. If you add any liquids, mix the ground beef well, then squeeze out the extra juice when forming patties.\nMake sure to let the meat get to room temperature before putting on the grill or in the pan. This will help the burgers cook evenly and fully.\nYou can use almost any type of minced (ground) meat to make hamburgers, including pork, chicken, turkey, lamb, bison, venison, ostrich, or even a meat substitute such as Quorn.  Some variations of hamburgers call for mixing different types of meat (e.g. ground beef and ground pork).\nDo not add salt until right before you put the patty to cook.\nMixing ingredients in with the meat is purely optional. You can make a delicious burger by simply shaping patties and seasoning with kosher salt, ground pepper, and if you wish, some garlic powder and/or cayenne.\nDo not overmix the meat! You will wind up with a tough, dense, and dry burger. If you must mix herbs or spices in, do so by hand and be sparing in your mixing. Remember that you can season the outside of the patties if you wish.\nIf your burgers fall apart, adding an egg yolk will help keep it together. Buying lean ground beef will also help, although if the meat is too lean the burger may be excessively dry. Not mixing the ground meat in the first place will also ensure the patty's integrity.\nTry adding a pat of butter in the center of each burger for an excellent hamburger.\nYou may wish to experiment with including cheese in the centre of your burger before cooking.\nSpices which can work well in hamburgers include black pepper, chili (either fresh or powder), Worcestershire Sauce and soy sauce. Experiment to find good combinations.\nAlmost any herb can work, including basil, oregano and parsley.\nSome other things which are also sometimes added to hamburgers include: diced onions, bread crumbs, crushed saltine crackers.\nBurgers can also be smoked on a grill. Smoked burgers will appear red and glazed on the outside, but browned on the inside. Smoking a burger before grilling it is an excellent way to seal in the flavorful juices.\nSome vegan patties make excellent meat substitutes, especially for Hamburgers, where strong spices make the difference close to indistinguishable.\nHand-made burger patties always change shape during cooking, and always in the same way: the edges move in toward the middle. This means each burger will turn out less flat and more ball-shaped than the way you originally formed it. So for the best results, press the raw patties down much thinner than you want the finished burger to be."

All purpose flour presumed.  Weight of ground cumin was determined by multiple weighings.  Weight of instant yeast presumed the same as active dry yeast.  Presumed medium size onion.  Pinch defined as 1/16 teaspoon. \n\n| This amount of instant yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.775% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1.05% active dry yeast.  Fermentation times should be around 2 hours for these reduced yeast amounts provided fermentation temperatures are about 80 degF (27 degC). Cooler temperatures will result in somewhat longer fermentation times.  Further yeast reductions will result in less yeast flavor and longer bulk fermentation times.\n\n| This water was referred to in the procedure section, but was not listed as an ingredient.

Start baking breads slightly before reaching the \"double\" stage--as the oven heats, the dough continues to rise.\nPlace 11 hot charcoal briquettes on bottom and 17 on top.\nWhen bread is  2/3  baked, take off bottom coals.\nBrush with melted butter.\nConventional oven method\nPlace dough in a well-greased round pan. A cast-iron frying pan works well.\nLet rise for 1 hour.\nBake at 375degF for 1 hour.\nBrush with melted butter.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Rising bread requires warmth. Cool or dry weather inhibits the process. When outside temperatures are too cool for breads to rise, place 3-4 hot coals on top of the oven with bread inside. If it's windy, provide a windbreak.",
        "Conversion Notes": "| Weight conversions from USDA National Nutrient Database. Original recipe text and ingredient order preserved. Warm water defined as 40 degC, density adjustment applied.  All purpose flour presumed.\t\n\n| 80% water is the level used with no knead breads when using white flours. 60% water is sufficient hydration for all purpose flour and the \"jellyroll\" procedure outlined in this recipe.\n\n| This large amount of yeast will result in a perceptible yeast flavor.  Using longer fermentation periods may create a safety hazard with the pepperoni."
