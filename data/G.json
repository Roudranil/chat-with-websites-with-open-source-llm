It also often includes shirataki noodles. Gyudon is a very popular food in Japan, and it is commonly served with beni shoga (pickled ginger), shichimi seasoning, and a side dish of miso soup.

        "Ingredients": "2 tablespoons wheat-free low-sodium tamari\n 1/4 teaspoon yeast extract\n 1/2 teaspoon beet juice (for example, from canned beets)\n 1/4 teaspoon powdered shiitake mushroom (see notes)\n 1/4 onion powder\n4 ounces (110 g) extra-firm tofu\nCanola oil",
        "Procedure": "Make the marinade by mixing together tamari, yeast extract, beet juice, shiitake powder, and onion powder in a small mixing bowl. Make sure the mushroom powder and yeast extract are evenly incorporated with no lumps.\nDrain the tofu, pressing it to get rid of as much moisture as possible. Combine marinade with tofu, crushing the tofu into small pieces and allowing it to absorb the liquid evenly. Placing the tofu in a zip-top bag, pouring the marinade over it, sealing it, and then crushing the tofu with the fingers works well. You want no pieces of tofu larger than a fingernail.\nAllow sufficient time for the marinade to soak completely into the tofu, such as several hours or overnight.\nHeat a medium-sized non-stick skillet over medium heat. Using a small amount of canola oil--just enough to coat the cooking surface--saute the tofu, browning it to a golden color. Between the marinade and heat, it will achieve a medium-brown, but won't achieve the deep brown of ground beef or commercial ground beef substitute.\nOnce the tofu is browned, it will still be quite soft. You can improve its texture by spreading it out in the hot pan and allowing it to cool for some time.\nStore the ground tofu in the refrigerator. It can be reheated by heating it through in a skillet for whatever application you desire. It can be used as a filling for tacos, sloppy joes, meat sauces for pasta, and the like.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Regular soy sauce or even tamari can be too salty in the end. Wheat-free is only needed if a gluten-free result is desired.\nSome vendors sell products containing a significant amount of yeast extract (such as rice cakes with yeast extract) as gluten-free; this source recommends avoiding yeast extract as containing barley. If you want to avoid the yeast extract, you might try increasing the amount of mushroom powder and beet juice.\nMake mushroom powder by grinding dried shitake mushroom with a mortar and pestle until no large pieces remain. This takes some time, as the dried mushroom is slightly leathery."

        "desc": "Gravlax is salmon that is cured in salt and sugar. It is a common dish throughout Scandinavia. Gravlax is easy to make and makes a festive dish that is an excellent to serve at parties with many people. The process of curing fish in salt and sugar (grava) is not limited to salmon and works fine with any fatty fish although salmon is definitely the most common choice. Gravlax has been particularly popular and common in the northern regions of Scandinavia whose cold and fresh waters produce salmon of excellent quality. The basic recipe here has been used for generations and has its origins in the northernmost part of Sweden. Gravlax can be used either as a main dish or as an appetizer.\n",
        "Ingredients": "800 g (1.75 lb) fresh salmon filet, approximately 2-5 cm (1-2 inches) thick\n30 ml (2 Tbsp) salt\n30 ml (2 Tbsp) white granulated sugar\n45 ml (3 Tbsp) juniper berries\n300 ml (1  1/4 cups) gin (optional)\n5 ml (1 tsp) whole or crushed white pepper\n20-40 g (0.75-1.5 oz) fresh dill",
        "Procedure": "Cut the salmon filet into two equally-sized parts (if you are making gravlax for many people it is fine to use two filets instead). Freeze the salmon for at least 4 days at -18degC or colder to kill any parasites.\nAfter deep freezing the salmon remove it from the freezer and let it thaw, preferably overnight in the refrigerator. The salmon does not have to be completely thawed for the next steps.\nCombine the salt and sugar. Place the salmon, skin down, on a table. Rub the salt and sugar mix onto the pieces, then apply the juniper berries and pepper. Finally, cover with dill.\nPut one salmon piece on top of another, flesh side to flesh side so the skin it outside on both pieces, and place in a plastic bag. Add any leftover ingredients to the bag along with the gin.\nSeal the bag and place it in the refrigerator. Let the salmon cure in the mixture, turning the bag over once, preferably twice, a day for 4 days.\nAfter 4 days, the salmon is ready to serve. If you are not going to eat it immediately (it lasts a couple of days) move it to a fresh plastic bag or jar, removing the salty liquid that has formed in the original bag. If you keep it in the original bag the risk is that it may be too salty once you are about to serve it.\nUse a sharp knife to slice thin slices from the salmon at an angle. During slicing, also remove any remaining bones. The larger the piece of salmon the larger the angle and the larger surface area for the produced slices. Large slices look better when served.\nAs a main dish, serve with potato stew, boiled potatoes and gravlax sauce, or in a salad. As an appetizer, serve on crispbread or toast. Potato stew with some additional Dijon mustard is excellent addition to gravlax.\nSteps\n\n\nThawed salmon with the required ingredients.\n\n\n\nApply salt and sugar.\n\n\n\nApply pepper and juniper berries.\n\n\n\nCover with dill.\n\n\n\nPlace one piece on top of the other.\n\n\n\nSeal the salmon in a plastic bag and refrigerate.\n\n\n\nServe thin slices of the cured salmon.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Use the thick part of the salmon filet found towards the head. Don't use the part closest to the tail, since it is not thick enough.\nThe gin can be substituted by lemon or lime juice (like a ceviche).\nThe time can be greatly shortened by slicing the salmon thinly before curing it.  It can be ready with as little as 4 hours of curing time.  However, using this method means it should also be eaten sooner.\nWikipedia has related information at Gravlax"

        "desc": "Ginger beer is a traditional fermented drink that can be made as either a soft drink or an alcoholic drink. Make it in a carboy with more sugar or malt extract and with longer fermentation time to get alcoholic ginger beer.\n",
        "Ingredients": "100-300 grams fresh ginger root, peeled and grated\n1 whole lemon, zested and juiced OR 2 tsp cream of tartar mixed with lemon extract or zest to make a lemon juice substitute.\n500 grams sugar\nWater\nFermentation starter (see note)",
        "Procedure": "Simmer the ginger, lemon zest and sugar in about 1.5 L water for about 10 minutes.\nIf using yeast as the fermentation starter, rehydrate the yeast in a glass of warm water for 5 minutes.\nAdd the lemon juice and enough water to get 10 L to the fermenter (see note).\nLet the mixture sit in the fermenter until it has started bubbling well, which should take 8-12 hours with yeast or longer with kefir grains.\nBottle into PET bottles or other food-safe bottles.\nWhen the bottles are hard (not just firm) from the carbonation, put them into the fridge for storage.\nServe cold.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "For the fermentation starter, you can use kefir grains or tibicos, ginger beer plant, ginger bug, ale yeast, or bread yeast.\nLemon juice is to provide acidity as well as flavor.\nFor a fermenter, you can use anything from an old PET water bottle to a food-grade bucket or a large stainless-steel pot; don't use copper or aluminium.\nThe water used should be free of chlorine if possible (e.g. boiled and cooled, or filtered, or bottled spring water). This is because chlorine (or chloramine) will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the chlorine.\nOnce the ginger beer is fermenting, as evidenced by lots of tiny bubbles rising to the surface, it can be used as a leavening agent. Simply replace the water and yeast in a bread recipe with ginger beer, and leave to rise as normal.\nIf left to ferment longer (about a week) a yeasty colony called a ginger beer plant will develop. Carbonation will also increase, greatly raising the chances for bottle (or other container) exploding; therefore, it is advisable to use a carboy or suitable container with an airlock."

Simmer until it reaches a 1-string consistency syrup.\nRemove from the heat and keep warm.\nGhevar\nCombine the flour, arrowroot, and melted ghee in a bowl.\nVery gradually add 1 cup of water in a thin stream, whisking continuously and taking care to see that an emulsion is formed and the water and ghee do not separate.\nAdd 2 more cups of water again in a thin stream while whisking continuously. At no point should the ghee and water separate. The batter should be of a very thin coating consistency, a little thinner than crepe batter. More water can be added if required to achieve the required consistency. Keep the batter in a cool place away from the heat.\nAdd melted ghee to a kadhai or other pot/pan. If desired, place a ghevar mould or other metal ring mould in the pan. The ghee should come up to  3/4 of the height of the mould.\nHeat the pan over medium heat, and gradually pour a ladleful of the batter directly into the centre of the mould in a very thin stream. The batter should froth and migrate towards the edges of the mold.\nWhen the froth subsides, gradually add another spoonful to the centre in a thin stream. If the batter builds up in the center, use a skewer to push it towards the edges and maintain a hole in the center. Repeat seven times, adding the batter to the centre hole each time.\nIncrease the heat, and pour a few ladlefuls of hot ghee into the centre to help the ghevar cook.\nWhen the centre is firm and cooked and the whole thing is golden brown, pull the ghevar out gently by inserting a wooden skewer in the centre and pulling it out of the ghee. Let any excess ghee drip off.\nImmerse ghevar in sugar syrup, drain quickly, and place on a serving plate.\nRepeat the cooking steps, using the remaining batter to make 9 pieces of ghevar.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "A mould is not required to cook the ghevar; if the pot containing the ghee has a small enough diameter, it will act as the mold to shape the ghevar.\nUsually ghevar is served with piping hot rabri, a variety of very thick sweetened milk."
