        "desc": "This is a modern version of Jailhouse Chili, as served in the Texas prison system. In the early part of the 20th century, those likely to regularly spend time in local detention facilities in the American Southwest were said to rate the accommodations among themselves by the quality of the chili con carne they were served. This became a matter of local pride and competition with other communities.\n",
        "Ingredients": "25 lbs (11 kg) coarse-ground beef\n 1/2 lb (225 g) cumin\n 1/4 lb (110 g) chili powder\n 1/8  lb (55 g) paprika\n2 handfuls crushed dried red chile peppers\n 1/2 lb (225 g) finely-chopped garlic",
        "Procedure": "Sear beef in a little cooking oil (not lard) until lightly browned. Drop the seared beef and chili peppers in a large stock pot, and add enough water to keep the meat from burning. Bring to a boil, then lower heat, cover, and simmer about 30 minutes.\nTake pot off the stove and add spices and garlic. Put back on the stove, bring to a boil again, lower heat, and simmer another 90 minutes, keeping the lid on as much as possible. Stir when necessary, but remember that too much stirring will tear the meat. Add a little more water if anything seems seriously in danger of burning (but as little water as possible).\nTake pot off the stove and skim off all or most of the grease. Serve hot."

        "desc": "Atomic buffalo turds (also known as ABTs) are a variation of the jalapeno popper.\n",
        "Ingredients": "Jalapeno peppers\nCream cheese\nCocktail sausages\nBacon slices",
        "Procedure": "Halve the jalapeno peppers lengthwise and scrape out membrane and seeds.\nFill the peppers with cream cheese, and then place a cocktail sausage on top of the cream cheese.\nCut the bacon slices in half, and wrap each halved pepper in bacon. A cocktail stick or toothpick can be used to hold the ABTs together if needed.\nCook the ABTs by barbecuing, baking, or grilling. They are done when the bacon is crisped and the jalapeno has softened but not to the point of collapsing. When oven-baked or indirectly grilled, they are typically cooked at approximately 275degF (135degC) for 2 hours, or until bacon is crisped.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Try using cheddar cheese or other cheese in place of the cream cheese.\nIf the heat of the jalapeno peppers does not appeal, bell peppers may be used instead--quarter the bell peppers and scrape out the seeds before filling.\nThe ABTs can be basted with a barbecue sauce before being cooked."

Do this step two more times to get rid of harsh flavors in the beans.\nCover beans with water again, and simmer over low heat for 30-40 minutes, removing any scum. Add more water if it falls below the level of the beans. If the bean can be crushed easily by fingers, it is done; if not, cook more.\nCover, remove from the heat, and steam for 10 minutes.\nDrain the beans and liquid, reserving both the liquid and beans. Set the beans aside.\nReturn the bean liquid to saucepan, and add sugar and salt. Heat until the sugar and salt have dissolved, then remove from the heat.\nTransfer the beans to the pan of syrup.

Be careful not to burn it.\nLet it cool before using.\nDough\nIn a small bowl, sprinkle yeast and sugar evenly over the lukewarm water; stir until yeast dissolves. Let stand 10 minutes or until foamy.\nIn large bowl or in food processor, combine flour and yeast mixture and mix well, or process 1 minute.
