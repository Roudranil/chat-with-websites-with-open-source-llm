        "desc": "A quiche is a baked, unsweetened custard pie, often made with savory fillings. Originally served in Germany, quiche was adopted by neighboring France and is now considered a traditional French dish. The French (and now English) word quiche comes from a dialectal form (Kuchle) of the German word for cake (Kuchen). Quiche became popular in Britain after World War II and in the United States during the 1960s and 70s.\n",
        "Ingredients": "5 eggs\n1  1/3  cup (320 ml) cream (approximately 30% fat)\n1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon\n1 dash ground nutmeg\n 1/4 teaspoon salt\n 1/8  teaspoon ground pepper\n1 prepared frozen pie crust\n 3/4 cup (180 ml) freshly-grated Swiss cheese",
        "Procedure": "Preheat oven to 375degF (190degC).\nPlace the eggs, cream, tarragon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend as briefly as possible until they form a homogeneous mixture.\nIn the pie crust, create alternating layers of the shredded cheese and the mixture from the blender until the crust is full.\nBake the quiche for 35-40 minutes; a toothpick or fork inserted into its middle should come out \"clean\".\nRemove the quiche from the oven, and let it cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Use nutmeg sparingly.\nFresh tarragon will be better than dried tarragon.\nPlacing a very hot pan in under the quiche will give it greater volume.\nTry making quiches with sauteed onions, sauteed broccoli, and shredded sharp cheddar cheese; feel free to experiment.",
        "Warnings": "The quiche mixture may drip over the edge of the pie crust while cooking; place it on a cookie sheet or place foil on the oven rack below it.\nThe quiche will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven; be careful not to overcook it or cut it before it has had a chance to set.\nHalf-and-half (cream with approximately 12% fat) can be substituted for regular cream to make this dish less fattening; however, be cautious of using milk because low-fat dairy products curdle more easily."

        "Procedure": "Meat filling\nSweat the chopped onion in a mixture of oil and butter.\nCombine the onion with the minced pork, bacon, cheese, soaked bread, parsley, eggs, salt, and pepper.\nReserve.\nRicotta filling\nCombine the ricotta, grated cheese, parsley, eggs, salt, and pepper.\nReserve.\nMeat and rice filling\nCombine all ingredients together.\nReserve.\nAssembly\nDepending on the size of the squash, either cut off a lid and use whole or else cut in half.\nCarefully scoop out the squash flesh, leaving a 1 cm thick shell or boat to fill. The removed flesh can be diced and added to the filling ingredients if desired.\nFill each hollowed squash with some of one of the fillings. Do not fill to the top, as the eggs (and rice if using) will expand.\nCombine the breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Dip the top of each filled squash in the topping ingredients (or sprinkle evenly on top) to help seal the filling in.\nCooking\nCook the filled squash in one of the following three ways:\nBaking (suitable for all 3 fillings): Place a layer of sliced potatoes and onions in a baking dish. Season with salt, pepper, and caraway seed, and moisten with stock. Place the stuffed squash on top. Cover with foil, and bake 30 minutes at 180@C. Remove the foil and continue baking for about 10-15 minutes to crisp the top.\nPot roasting (suitable for all 3 fillings): Closely pack the stuffed squash in a pot. Fill with water to just over halfway up the squash. Cover with a lid, and cook on medium heat until the squashes are tender and the rice or meat filling cooked through (about 35 minutes).\nSimmering (not suitable for ricotta filling): Place carefully-sealed squash in a simmering meat broth (made with root vegetables and meat bones) and simmer on low heat for about 40 minutes. You can serve the strained broth as a first course and the vegetables and stuffed squash as a second course.\nServe hot.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "For the pot roasting method, you may set the squash on a bed of chopped onion and drizzle with a little olive oil and tomato paste."
