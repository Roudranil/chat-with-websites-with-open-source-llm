        "desc": "French toast is a common breakfast or dessert item made by frying a piece of bread soaked in an egg batter. French toast was developed as a way to use day-old stale bread. The literal translation of pain perdu is lost bread, referring to old or stale bread. When lacking stale bread, toasting your bread lightly will help it absorb more of the egg and milk batter.\n",
        "Ingredients": "French toast\n1 egg\nAbout  1/4 cup (60 ml / 2 oz) milk or cream (more for softer, less eggy French toast; less for firmer, more eggy toast)\n2-3 slices bread (see notes)\nButter, margarine, or cooking oil\nOptional flavorings\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or similar\n 1/4-1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon or other powdered spices suitable for sweet foods\n 1/2 teaspoon sugar  or honey\n 1/4 teaspoon salt\n 1/4 teaspoon pepper\nSuggested toppings\nMaple syrup\nJam, jelly, fruit syrup\nWhipped cream\nPowdered sugar\nNuts\nHoney\nBacon\nRaspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and/or bananas",
        "Procedure": "In a bowl, mix eggs and milk, and optional ingredients.\nHeat up a frying pan, skillet, or griddle to medium-low heat.\nGrease the pan with butter, margarine, or cooking spray.\nSoak a slice of bread in the egg-milk mixture and place on pan; repeat until pan is full or desired amount is placed.\nCook, turning once, until both sides of the bread are browned and the inside is cooked through.\nServe on plates, with toppings as desired.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The goal is to get both sides of the French toast nicely browned, while making sure the center is cooked. Using excessive heat could scorch the outside of the toast while leaving the inside undercooked.\nIf making a small batch, soak the two slices until almost all of the mixture has been absorbed. If the bowl is small, place the two slices on top of each other, and keep switching and flipping them, so that all four sides will absorb the mixture.\nThe cooking process is too short to use most raw spices, but some fresh herbs might be very tasty.\nIf using sandwich bread, a plastic sandwich container may be used for the egg-milk mixture. This allows maximum use of the mixture, as the container is a good size and shape.\nToast your bread before dipping it into the mix to create a solid base.\nThe following types of bread are good used for French toast. Hard crust breads are recommended. Softer breads will create a soggy toast.\nSourdough\nChallah\nSchiacciata\nPortuguese sweet bread (\"Massa Suvada\"). This bread will take your french toast to new heights.\nWhole-wheat raisin bread or schiacciata.\nKing's Hawaiian Sweet Bread\nPanettone (bread with raisin, but may be too sweet for some)\nBrioche (weaved bread)\nChinese bakery loaves of bread.

        "Procedure": "In the oil.\nPeel potatoes, and cut into thin straw-like pieces.\nWash potatoes well with water to remove excess starch.\nPlace fries in a saucepan with water, and simmer or parboil on the stove for about 15 minutes.\nDrain the fries, and dry them well.\nDeep fry in 175degC vegetable oil, lard, or drippings for 4-5 minutes until light golden and crisp.\nRemove from oil, and place on plate with paper towels to absorb the leftover cooking oil. Transfer to another plate if necessary.\nAdd salt and shake to ensure all French fries are evenly salted.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "You can vary the size of the potato slices. Thick wedge shapes are home-style fries or English-style chips, while thinly julienned potatoes make for shoestring potatoes. Cooking times will need to be adjusted accordingly.\nTry adding other spices after cooking. Minced garlic is popular in California cuisine.\nInstead of ketchup, serve with mayonnaise, gravy, barbecue sauce, or salt, hummus, and vinegar.\nFor poutine (a French-Canadian treat), toss cooked fries with cheese curds and smother with gravy.\nSome cook the fries a single time in a generous amount of oil pre-heated to a temperature around 375 degF (190 degC) until they are golden and slightly crisp.\nThe method recommended by most cookbooks and used by many restaurants, is to cook them in two stages: first at around 350 degF (177 degC) until the fries are nearly cooked but limp and pale; after they have been removed from the oil and allowed to cool, they are briefly fried at a higher temperature of around 375 degF (190 degC) until golden and crisp.\nA method attributed to the celebrated French chef Joel Robuchon for the home cook says to put the sliced potatoes into a saucepan with just enough cold oil in it to cover the potatoes, then to cook them over high heat until golden, stirring occasionally.[1]",
        "Warnings": "Do not attempt to extinguish fat fires with water! If the oil becomes too hot, it may catch fire. Do not attempt to extinguish it with water, as this will cause an explosive reaction: oil floats on water, so water will only help the oil move up and get more oxygen. Instead, turn off the stove if possible, try to cover fire with a lid or any other piece of solid, non-flammable material, and use a class B fire extinguisher if the fire is still not under control. If that fails to work, evacuate and call the emergency service.",

Stir until the mixture has thickened and starts to boil up.\nAway from the heat, add the kirschwasser and blend in.

Skewer cubes of bread with a fondue fork and dip into the cheese, turning the fork over to coat all sides. If you are especially hygiene conscious, agree between yourselves to slide the bread off onto your plates and eat it with a separate fork, resting the fondue fork in the caquelon while you are eating.",
        "Troubleshooting": "If the right conditions for emulsification are not present, the aqueous and fatty components of a fondue may separate in much the same way as a mayonnaise may do so. This can be caused by the wrong  proportion of liquid to fat. In mayonnaise making, the problem occurs as a result of adding the oil too quickly. In a fondue the problem may occur in a number of ways:\nWhen using the traditional method (straight wine and cheese), melting occurs too rapidly.\nThe water boils off leaving too much fat in proportion to aqueous component.\nThe aqueous component is too great to hold an emulsion.\nThere is insufficient starch to stabilize the emulsion.\nA combination of the above.\nThe most effective solution is to:\nDissolve some more cornstarch in a half cup (50 ml) of wine.\nPut the fondue back on the stove top over medium heat.\nWhen it is boiling, lower the heat and slowly add the slurry while beating vigorously until thickening of the starch has occurred.\nIf it is too thick, add more wine, a little at a time until the right consistency is achieved, stirring constantly.\nIf necessary add some more grated cheese to taste.\nOnce you learn how it's done, this is always effective.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "It is necessary to use bread of the correct texture and size. The bread should not be too soft and it should be cubed in such a way that each cube retains part of the crust. The cube is then pierced through the crust into the crumb. This prevents the bread from slipping off into the fondue.  This sometimes happens anyway, of course, and in Switzerland there is a tradition when eating fondue in a restaurant (optional depending on the crowd), that if one is guilty, one buy a round of schnapps for the whole party.\nA rule of thumb is to use 200 g (8 oz) cheese per 100 ml ( 1/2 cup) wine"

The mash should not get too runny, but add some of the cream and grate some nutmeg into the potato as well.\nPut the cooked fish into the bottom of an oven-proof dish, with any remaining milk sauce. The dish should not be too large as it is nice to build a couple of layers of the fish, rather than lay it out in one layer. Once you have done this, pat the fish gently down a little so that it is slightly compacted.\nSpread the mashed potato over the top of the fish to a height of about 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) making sure it is flat, and not piled up in the middle. Using a fork, ridge the top of the potato as this will make it colour up nicely in the oven.\nAt this stage, if you want, add the grated cheese over the potato, and if you are feeling artistic, decorate the top of the pie with some large peeled prawns around the edge of the fish, and maybe a decoration in the middle.\nPlace the pie in the oven at 220degC and leave for about 30 minutes or so, until the top of the potato/grated cheese is nicely coloured and the potato is bubbling nicely.\nRemove from the oven and serve immediately.",

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The rum has to have at least 50% alcohol; otherwise the flambeing won't work. If the rum has a higher percentage of alcohol (>60%) the flame will be very big. Proceed with caution and add the rum slowly.\nIf you can't obtain a zuckerhut, substitute sugar cubes.\nIf you can't obtain a feuerzange, replace it with a grate.\nInstead of the feuerzangenbowle bowl and heater, you can also use a big pot on a normal cooking plate. A very appealing solution for a feuerzangenbowle bowl is a large (5 L or so) lab glass beaker (not previously used for its original purpose). It combines heat resistance and transparency, adding to the effect."

This is where some gluten develops, so experiment with more or less whisking to your taste.\nPour the rest of the wet mixture in, and whisk to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight. This is when the flavor and the rest of the gluten develops.\nLet batter come to room temperature for about 30 minutes.\nHeat the pan over medium heat.

If you mess up, no worries, just cook it through and eat it.\nWhen the crepe starts separating from the pan, you can flip it. If you like it crispier, let it cook more but don't burn it. You can flip with any utensil a few inches wide and thin enough to slide under the crepe. The hotter the pan, the faster it will cook. It's possible to cook a crepe in 20 seconds or so with high heat, but there's nothing wrong with cooking it slow on low heat.\nServe crepes warm.\nTo store, wrap airtight so they don't lose moisture, and refrigerate. Reheat on the stovetop.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Dairy free crepes: use Oatly or similar neutral-tasting non-dairy milk, and try some of the full fat variety to get the consistency similar what you can do with the heavy cream. Substitute 1.5 tbsp of a neutral oil like grapeseed for the butter.\nSee the base crepe recipe for more serving suggestions."

The shape of the Figolla is traditionally an Easter related figure, but today one can buy commercially produced figolli in all shapes. See below for how to get the right shapes. This recipe is for preparing plain figolli, but they should always be decorated with either a chocolate covering or, more typically, with decorative icing. \n",
        "Ingredients": "Pastry\n800 g self-raising flour\n200 g margarine\n200 g white granulated sugar\n4 eggs\n1 orange, zested\n2-3 tablespoons water\nFilling\n200 g pure ground almonds\n100 g white granulated sugar\n125 ml water",
        "Procedure": "Dough\nSift the flour into a bowl, and rub in the margarine until the mixture returns to a powdery consistency.\nIn a separate container, mix the eggs and sugar until well blended.\nMix the orange zest into the egg and sugar.\nFold the egg mixture into the flour mixture.\nIf necessary mix in some water to help the mixture form a dough. Add the water very carefully, drop by drop, as you will only need a little bit, and too much will ruin the pastry.\nFilling\nIn a small skillet, gently heat the water and dissolve all the sugar into it.\nOnce the sugar has completely dissolved, bring the water to the boil, and immediately remove from the heat.\nStir the ground almonds into the hot sugar solution. Mix well until you get a paste-like filling.\nAssembly\nFigolli Shapes\nFlour a clean surface, and roll out about a quarter of the dough with a rolling pin.\nCut two identical figolli shapes (see image) from the dough and remove the excess.\nSpread about a quarter of the filling on one of the shapes. Leave a 1-2 cm border without any filling on it.\nPlace the second identical shape on top of the first, making sure to align both shapes properly.\nPress the edges of the two pieces of dough all around so they seal. Wetting the fingers with some cold water can help if the 2 layers are difficult to combine.\nRepeat the above steps for the other 3 figolli.\nTo bake, preheat the oven to 190 degC. Place double layer of baking paper on a baking tray, and place the figolli gently on paper.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top turns golden and the edges start becoming dark (about 30 minutes).",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "To get the right shapes, you should use metal cut-out templates that are like cookie cutters but larger. Alternatively, a printable template is available. Print the picture on an A4 sheet of paper, then cut the shape with scissors. Stack 3-4 sheets of paper and glue them together for stiffness, or print on cardboard if your printer allows it. Place the cut-out on the pastry and follow it with the end of a very sharp pointed knife. While this will not give the finest results, the traditional Maltese figolla is expected to be modest in appearance, and only factory-produced ones are regularly shaped.\nThese shapes are a rather small size of figgola, so with the above quantities your figolli might turn out a bit on the fat side compares to what is typical. On the other hand, the larger the ratio of filling to pastry the more tasty the figolla tends to be."
