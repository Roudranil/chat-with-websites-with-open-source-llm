        "desc": "Melanzane alla parmigiana is a typical Italian dish, existing in different forms in most parts of Italy. Northerners claim it as their own because of the name. Southerners, in particular Sicilians, claim that it originated in the south and that \"Parmigiana\" is a misunderstanding for \"Palmigiana\", which is a type of shutter, alluding to the way in which the eggplant slices are laid. There are some variations (including a dessert version with chocolate) but mostly the ingredients are: eggplants, tomato sauce, basil leaves, mozzarella, and, obviously, Parmesan cheese.\n",
        "Ingredients": "2 kg (4 lb) eggplants\n700 g (24 oz) fresh cooking tomatoes, or one large or two medium cans of plum tomatoes\n1 kg (2 lb) cows' milk mozzarella cheese, known in Italy as fiordilatte\n 1/2 large or 1 medium onion, sliced\nOlive oil\nFresh basil leaves\nParmesan or Grana Padano cheese",
        "Procedure": "Cut eggplants lengthwise in  1/4 inch (0.75cm) thick slices, and put them in a plate covered by plenty of salt for about 1 hour. Wash off the excess salt and dry the slices with a paper towel.\nStart cooking the onion slices in olive oil; when the onion is soft add drained whole tomatoes and mash them with a fork. If the tomatoes are watery, add a small can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Add 2 leaves of basil and simmer for about 20 minutes.\nWhile the tomato sauce is cooking, fry the eggplant slices as follows. Fill a frying pan (cast iron if you have it) with  1/2 inch (1 cm) of olive oil and heat. When the oil is hot, start frying the eggplant slices a few at a time so that they do not overlap in the pan. Cook until golden, flipping once. Remove the eggplants and put them in a drainer so the excess oil can drain. Repeat until all the slices are cooked.\nTo assemble, start with a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a greased ovenproof baking pan or casserole. Then proceed with a layer of eggplants with their edges slightly overlapped and no voids. Add basil leaves and a layer of sliced mozzarella. Continue alternating layers until the eggplant is used up, and finish topping with tomato sauce and grated Parmesan or grana.\nBake in the oven for about 40 minutes at 350degF (180degC). Serve really hot. If you are lucky enough to have leftovers, they taste even better the day after."

        "Procedure": "If desired, blanch or parboil the chopped onion in a small amount of water so that the onion flavor is not as strong. Drain and cool thoroughly.\nDrain the English peas, and either discard the liquid or use for some other purpose.\nLightly rinse the peas in a colander and place in a suitable bowl.\nChop the egg into about  1/4 inch (0.5 cm) pieces.

Mix lightly until all the ingredients are well-distributed.\nAdd salt and ground pepper to taste, and mix to distribute.\nRefrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\nServe cold, sprinkled lightly with parsley in the manner of a side dish, rather than as a separate course. No additional dressings or condiments would ordinarily be served or expected.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Try adding 2 Tbsp very finely-chopped ( 1/8  inch /  1/4 cm diced) celery\nAdding  1/4 cup (or less) cubed ( 3/8  inch or 0.75 cm diced) yellow cheese food product (for example Velveeta) gives a color contrast, but the cheese can become somewhat soft if the salad is stored. If you make the main part of the salad well in advance of serving, you may wish to wait to add cheese only when you are nearly ready to serve the sal ad.\nIf you use the entire egg, the yolk will impart a yellow tint to the salad dressing, while using the 2 hard-boiled egg white (i.e. no yolks) will keep the salad dressing white. Adding hard-boiled egg whites provides a shape and color contrast compared to the green color of the round peas.\nYou may wish to make the basic recipe a day or several hours in advance of serving, through the refrigeration step, then add other ingredients when nearly ready to serve."

While kneading the dough, gradually add in more water until the dough is soft and stretchy. If the dough becomes sticky, add more flour.\nOnce the dough is the desired consistency, allow to rest for a couple minutes, then roll it out to a thickness of ~2-3 mm (1/10 inch).\nCut the dough into discs roughly 10-15 cm (4-6 inches) in diameter.\nArgentinian filling\nDice onion into small pieces and saute in vegetable oil in a large frying pan. Add ground beef, and brown it.\nWhile beef is browning, mix in salt, sugar and spices.\nOnce meat has finished cooking, remove from heat and add raisins.\nIf desired add sliced olives, egg, or potatoes.\nChilean filling\nDice onion into small pieces and saute in olive oil in a large frying pan. Mince garlic and add to the onions. Add and brown ground beef.\nWhile beef is browning, mix in salt, sugar, spices and bay leaf.\nAllow to simmer for about 20 minutes for flavours to blend.\nRemove bay leaf, and add olives and raisins.\nAssembly\nPlace 1-2 tablespoons of empanada filling into the center of one of the dough discs (tapa).\nIf Chilean empanadas are being made add one piece of the diced hardboiled egg next to the filling.\nWet the outer edge of the tapa with cold water and fold the tapa in half to encase the filling, ensuring there is no air left inside (the wet portion will help the dough stick together, air will burst out when cooked).\nHolding the empanada in the palm of one hand, with the round edge pointing outwards, pinch and twist over a small (finger-sized) portion of the dough at the top. Continue pinching and twisting around the outer edge until you reach the bottom of the empanada, so that the open edge is sealed shut.  You can also use a fork to smash together the lips of the outer edge, but it is not the traditional way and the filling can burst through.\nRepeat for the remaining filling and dough.\nTo cook the empanadas, deep fry in vegetable oil on medium heat until golden brown. Alternatively, you can brush them with butter and bake on a cookie sheet in the oven at 400 degF for 8-10 minutes or until light brown.\nAllow empanadas to cool and then eat.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "For a flakier crust, before cutting it into discs, lightly coat the dough with olive oil and dust with cornstarch. Fold the dough in half (with the cornstarch on the inside) and again coat with oil and cornstarch. Fold again and roll out to a thickness of ~2-3 mm (1/10 inch)."

Stir at low speed with an electric mixer for 1 minute. Mix at medium speed for 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl frequently.\nFlour the raisins lightly and add them to the mixture.\nMix additional flour with a spoon,  1/4- 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl or it becomes difficult to add more flour. Baker's discretion.\nCover with plastic wrap and a towel. Place in a warm place with no drafts until the batter doubles in volume, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.\nStir down with a spoon (about 25 strokes).\nDivide into 2 loaf pans. Wet your fingers and push the dough into the corners and smooth out.\nCover with plastic. Place in a warm place and let the dough rise until it just reaches the tops of the pans (about 25 minutes). Watch carefully and don't let the dough rise too high (punch it down and let it rise again if it does).\nBake at 375degF (190degC) for 30-45 minutes. The bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom of the pan and is browned to the baker's preference.\nTurn out on a wire rack and let cool.",
        "Conversion notes": "| Weight conversions from USDA National Nutrient Database. Original recipe text and ingredient order preserved. All purpose flour presumed.  Density adjustments not made to either warm or hot water.  Brown sugar presumed as packed.  Water at 237 g per cup used for conversion instead of buttermilk at 244 g per cup.  Raisins presumed as unpacked.\t\n\n|  This dough has enough sugar that osmotolerant yeast will likely provide better results without any need to increase the inoculation. This excessive amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommended to use no more than 0.775% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, or 1.05% active dry yeast, although in both cases you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions will result in less yeast flavor and longer bulk fermentation times."

        "desc": "These long, puffy buns are filled with cream and topped with rich chocolate icing. The buns are made with choux pastry, which is made by bringing butter and water to the boil, tipping in the flour and then beating in the eggs. \n",
        "Ingredients": "Choux pastry\n75 g (2 1/2 oz /  2/3  stick) butter, diced\n200 ml (7 fl oz /  3/4 cup) water\nSalt\n100 g (4 oz /  3/4 cup) strong plain flour\n3 eggs, beaten\nCream filling\n250 ml (9 fl oz / 1 cup) double or whipping cream\nChocolate icing\n100 g (4 oz /  1/2 cup) caster sugar\n100 ml (3 1/2 oz /  3/8  cup) water\n50 g (2 oz) dark chocolate\n25 g (1 oz /  1/4 stick) unsalted butter",
        "Procedure": "Choux pastry\nHeat the oven to 200degC / 400degF / Gas 6.\nPlace the butter, water and a pinch of salt in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon as the butter melts. Meanwhile, sift the flour into a small bowl.\nWhen the butter has melted, turn up the heat and bring the mixture to the boil. Switch off the heat and quickly tip the flour into the saucepan. Immediately beat the flour into the liquid with the wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients together. Stop beating when the mixture swells into a smooth dough that comes away from the sides of the saucepan. This should take only a few seconds.\nLet the mixture cool for 3-4 minutes. Pour in a little of the beaten egg into the flour mixture and beat it in well. Keep adding and beating in the egg, a little at a time, until the dough looks thick, smooth and shiny and still holds its shape well. You may not need the last two or three tablespoonfuls of egg if your eggs are large.\nSpoon the mixture into a large freezer bag or a piping bag (you'll need to scrape it out of the pan with a flexible spatula). Fold down the top of the bag to squeeze the dough to the bottom. Snip off one of the bottom corners of the bag to give you a hole about 1 cm long.\nLine two flat baking sheets with baking parchment. Squeeze the mixture into chipolata-sized sausage shapes on to the parchment, allowing about 4 cm between each one (they will at least double in size in the oven). You should be able to make about 12.\nPlace the baking sheets in the preheated oven, and bake for about 30 minutes. Take the eclairs out when they are puffed up, golden brown all over, and feel hard when you poke one with a knife.\nImmediately take each eclair off the baking sheet--they will be very hot, so wear oven gloves--and, with the point of a knife, gently slit the side to let out the steam. Otherwise, the steam sits trapped in the eclair and turns back to water, leaving you with a soggy bun.\nLeave eclairs to cool and dry out on a wire rack.\nCream filling\nWhip the cream in a small bowl until it is just thick enough to hold its shape.\nPlace whipped cream in the fridge while you make the chocolate icing.\nChocolate icing\nFor the icing, place the sugar and water in a small saucepan over a low heat. Heat gently, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar.\nBring to the boil, and boil fast for three minutes. Switch off the heat and wait for a few minutes for the syrup to cool down (you can speed this up by dipping the base of the pan in a bowl of cold water if you like).\nBreak up the chocolate and cut the butter into chunks.\nWhen the syrup is very warm, rather than very hot, add the chocolate and butter. Stir until both have melted and blended to a smooth, glossy sauce.\nLeave to cool, stirring occasionally. When the sauce starts to thicken, it's time to ice your eclairs.\nAssembly\nWhen the buns are cool, use a teaspoon or a piping bag to fill the inside of each eclair with whipped cream (you may need to enlarge the slit you made before).\nTake a different teaspoon and smear the chocolate icing generously over each eclair.\nLeave the eclairs on the wire rack until the icing has set. In the unlikely event that you're not going to eat them straight away, you can put them in the fridge for a few hours."

        "Ingredients": "1 large ripe eggplant (aubergine)\n2-3 tablespoons (30-45 g) tahini\n1-2 lemons, juiced and strained\n2-3 cloves fresh garlic\nSalt\nOlive oil",
        "Procedure": "Roast the eggplant on open flame. If your stove is electric, split the eggplant lengthwise, place face down on a cookie sheet, and bake in a hot oven on the top rack 30-45 minutes. For open flame roasting, use a fork to turn often. The skin should wrinkle and char, and flesh will shrivel and become soft. When eggplant is completely soft all over, remove to a bowl, slash once or twice to drain out bitter juice, and let rest until cool enough to handle. Some cooks suggest cooling the eggplant inside a brown paper bag.\nCut off stem and peel away skin. Scrape flesh into bowl of food processor or blender. Add garlic, tahini, lemon juice and process. Quantities depend upon size of eggplant and your preferences-please taste frequently. Salt to taste.\nServe at room temperature, drizzled with olive oil, and garnished with a black or green Mediterranean olive or sprigs of cilantro or parsley.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "If you don't have a food processor or blender, the eggplant is quite easy to mash by hand. Mash the garlic with the flat of a broad knife, then mince it fine. Some cooks prefer mashing by hand to mechanical means as the blades of food processors can break the seeds, which releases undesirable bitter flavours. If you have a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic with salt into a paste. A large mortar and pestle can be used to mash all ingredients."
