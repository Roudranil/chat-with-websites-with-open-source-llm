        "Procedure": "Dissolve 1 tablespoon brown sugar in warm water in a small bowl. Add yeast and let stand until sponge/foamy.\nPlace remaining  1/2 cup brown sugar, 4 cups flour, and salt in large mixing bowl, then briefly mix.\nMix the dough:\nIf using stand mixer: using dough hook on low speed, add yeast mixture, oil, and warm milk, and mix for 2 minutes. Stop and scrape bowl if necessary. Continuing on low speed, add remaining flour,  1/2 cup at a time, until dough clings to hook and cleans sides of bowl. Continue to on low speed to knead the dough at least 2 minutes. The coarseness of the bran may prevent the dough from forming a ball on the hook, but so long as the hook is getting contact with the dough kneading will be accomplished. Be cautious adding the flour--never more than 6 cups--as the bread may become very dry.\nIf working by hand: add yeast mixture, oil, and warm milk, working with a spoon at first and then with clean hands. Dough will be difficult to get to mix in all the flour, but you can do it! Turn onto a floured surface where you can work in additional flour, adding about  1/4 cup at a time and working completely in before adding more. Knead until firm.\nPlace dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover, and let rise in warm place free of drafts for about 1 hour, until doubled in size.\nPunch down and divide in half. Shape into a loaf and place in greased loaf pan. Cover, let rise in warm place free of drafts about another hour, until doubled in size.\nBake in an oven at 400degF (200 degC) for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350degF (175degC) and bake for another 30 minutes or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.\nRemove immediately from pans and cool on wire racks.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The 100% whole wheat will not knead to a silken smooth dough. Kneading will often work some of the coarser bran out of the dough, depending on the type of flour you have on hand. The finer the milling, and the higher gluten, the better the whole-wheat bread.\nVariation - Whole wheat rolls\nAdd 1-2 Tablespoons brown sugar, and increase the yeast to 3 packages. Raise for about 15 minutes, then divide for rolls, below, and raise in warm oven (90degF / 30degC) for 15 minutes. Bake at 425degF (220degC) for 12, or until lightly tanned. For spiral rolls: divide in half, roll to 12x9-inch (30x20 cm) rectangle. Cut into 10-12 equal-width strips, and roll each strip tightly. For clover leaves: divide dough into 24 equal portions. Form each piece into a ball and place in greased muffin pan. With scissors, cut each ball in half, then quarters. Place on greased baking sheets about 2 inches (5 cm) apart."

    "Cookbook:White Sauce": {
        "url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:White_Sauce",
        "desc": "White sauce is a common name (chiefly in the US and Britain) for the classic Bechamel Sauce, one of the \"Mother Sauces\" of French Cuisine. In French cooking, Bechamel Sauce is rarely used on its own; it is more often used as the base for derivitave sauces or as a binder for gratinees. Bechamel's American cousin, on the other hand, is frequently used as a finished product. White sauce is generally more highly seasoned than is Bechamel, but the procedure for making both is the same.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter\n 1/4 cup (60 g) all-purpose flour\n2 cups (480 ml) whole milk\n 3/4 tsp onion salt\n 1/4 tsp ground white pepper\n1 tsp ground mustard seed\n1 pinch fresh-ground nutmeg\n1 bay leaf",
        "Procedure": "Make a white roux: melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat until the foam subsides. Add the flour and whisk together, still over the heat, for 2-3 minutes. The flour should lose its raw smell but should not brown.\nAdd the milk to the roux while whisking quickly but smoothly to create a smooth mixture.\nAdd the seasonings and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Simmer the sauce until it lightly coats the back of a spoon.\nRemove the bay leaf, taste and adjust for salt and pepper, and serve.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "A sweet white sauce can be made by replacing the seasoning items with sugar (preferably caster). Adding rum or brandy to taste will make this the sweet sauce traditionally served with Christmas pudding.\nThe seasonings can be adjusted according to individual taste and the intended use: some dishes will require a more highly seasoned sauce, others a milder concoction.\nThe flavor can also be altered by adding various herbs (parsley, celery leaves, thyme, etc.) along with the other seasonings. Generally, additions should be strained from the sauce prior to use--straining would not apply, for instance, to traditional parsley sauce, typically served with fish, in which the green of the herb is an integral ingredient. Keep in mind that the sauce should be mildly flavored and that any additions should complement the finished dish, not overpower it.\nWhite sauce can be made ahead-of-time: remove from the heat and press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the sauce to prevent it from forming a skin. Reheat over a low flame, stirring constantly, until it barely simmers.\nIn the event that lumps have formed in your sauce, simply pour through a medium strainer before serving."

        "Procedure": "Wash and debone the fish, and cut it into  1/2 x  1/2 inch (about 1 x 1 cm) chunks.\nSeason the fish with salt, pepper, aji limo, and rocoto. Marinate the fish for a few minutes to \"cold cook\" them; leaving it for too long will \"overcook\" the fish. You should have enough lime juice to completely cover the fish.\nAdd the onion and mix gently.\nServe on a bed of lettuce, and add two pieces of corn on the cob and a portion of sweet potato.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Ceviche can be eaten as an entree as well. In this case, this will be enough for about two people.\nMore traditional recipes call for much less marinating. In fact, some will marinate it for as little as 10 minutes total (basically just the time it takes to get the sides ready). If marinating for a small amount of time be aware that the acidity of the lime is the only thing that \"cooks\" the fish."

        "Procedure": "Chill a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes. If using a mixer with various kinds of beaters, use the whisk attachment. This step is very important, because the cream will not rise if the mixer is warm.\nIn the chilled bowl, whip heavy cream until soft peaks form. Do not over-beat, as this will yield butter.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "You must use a grade of cream with a fat content of at least 30%, since the fat is what stabilizes the whipped cream.\nUnlike when whipping egg whites, it's not important to make sure there's no fat in the mixture (after all, the cream itself is high in fat). It is important, however, to make sure that the bowl and mixers are dry and cold and that the cream is cold.\nTo sweeten the cream, about 2 tablespoons of sugar per cup (0.25 L) of heavy cream are appropriate."
