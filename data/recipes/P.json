        "desc": "Puri, also spelled poori is a fried Indian bread.\n",
        "Ingredients": "2 oz (60 g) whole-wheat flour\n2 oz (60 g) plain white flour\n2 oz fine semolina\n 1/4 tsp salt\n1 tbsp vegetable oil for the dough\nAbout 500 ml (1 pint) vegetable oil for deep frying\nWater to mix the dough",
        "Procedure": "Dough\nPut all the dry ingredients into a bowl.\nAdd salt and drizzle the 1 tbsp oil over top. Mix well.\nGradually mix in enough water to get a stiff dough.\nKnead the dough well for a few minutes.\nCover the dough and leave to rest for about half an hour.\nFrying\nPour the oil for deep frying in a wok or other deep pan. Heat the oil.\nMeanwhile, divide the dough into 8 small balls and roll each into a small circle (about 3 in / 7.5 cm in diameter). You can use a bit of hot oil to roll the dough so it will not stick to the surface.\nCheck if the oil is hot enough--when you put a tiny piece of dough in the oil it should immediately rise to the surface. When the oil is ready, lay the flattened dough over the oil, press the top slightly with the slotted spoon until it inflates itself, and turn to other side. Adjust the flame as necessary.\nRemove the puri from the oil after it turns golden brown and place on a wire rack or kitchen paper towel for excess oil to drain.",
        "Notes, tips and variations": "For chapatti dough, don't use semolina and plain flour. Only use whole wheat flour, salt, and oil.\nIf the dough sinks quickly to the bottom of the wok, the oil is not hot enough and the puri will absorb too much oil. It should balloon within a few seconds."

        "desc": "Pumpkin pie is a traditional American and Canadian holiday dessert. It consists of a pumpkin-based custard baked in a single pie shell. The pie is traditionally served with whipped cream.\n",
        "Ingredients": "2 cups (480 ml) milk, scalded\n2 cups (450 g) cooked and pureed pumpkin (or plain canned pumpkin)\n1 cup (240 ml) maple syrup\n 1/8  cup (30 g) sugar\n1 tbsp flour\n 1/2 tsp salt\n1 tsp ginger\n1 tsp cinnamon\n 1/4 tsp nutmeg (optional)\n2 large eggs, beaten\n1 unbaked 9-inch pie shell",

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "This recipe replaces much of the sugar normally found in a pumpkin pie recipe with maple syrup. Use only real 100% maple syrup, not maple-flavored pancake syrup, as their sugar content is different. You can also use brown sugar instead of maple syrup.\nPrepare the raw pumpkin by skinning and cutting into 1 inch cubes. Bake at 350degF (180degC) for 1 hour and then turn off the heat. Leave the pumpkin in the oven for another hour or two, which will reduce the moisture content. The pumpkin may also be steamed but may end up with too much moisture, resulting in a runny pie. A 10 inch (25 cm)-diameter pumpkin will make 4-6 pies. The pumpkin may also be baked whole and skinned afterwards.\nPumpkin pie has no top crust, which makes most forms of decoration impossible; however, for a more aesthetically-pleasing pie, put dollops of real whipped cream on each slice, or add a decorative rim to the side crust with artfully layered dough cut-outs in the shape of fall leaves, squash, or pumpkins.\nUse a smaller 'sugar pumpkin' instead of the big 'Jack O Lantern' pumpkin. Sugar pumpkins have a firm and smooth texture while the larger 'Jack O Lantern' pumpkin has a more stringy or fibrous texture and more watery flesh.\nVariations\nChocolate-covered pumpkin pie: After the pie has cooled, melt 2 oz (55 g) of sweetened chocolate (milk or dark) and pour over the top of the pie. Be sure to completely cover the pumpkin. Refrigerate to set the chocolate.\nPumpkin Pastries: Roll pie crust pastry thin and cut into circles approx 4\" in diameter. Put a spoonful of the cool pumpkin mixture towards one side of the center of the circle. Fold over the crust into a half-circle and firmly crimp the edges closed. Slice three small slits in the top for venting. Place on a greased cookie sheet. Bake only until crust is a light golden-brown, approx 10 minutes.\nSubstitutions\n14 oz (1 can) sweetened condensed milk can replace the scalded milk and maple syrup.\n2 cups of plain canned pumpkin can replace the cooked and strained pumpkin. Do not use \"pumpkin pie filling\", which has added spices. For a discussion on the use of canned pumpkin and the recipes attached, please see the talk page."

        "desc": "Poutine is common dish throughout the Quebec, Ontario, and Atlantic regions of Canada, made of French fries, cheese curds, and gravy. This recipe uses pre-canned gravy and fries the potatoes from scratch.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1 L vegetable oil for deep frying\n1 can (290 g) of poutine sauce (French: melange a sauce poutine) or gravy\n5 medium potatoes\n2 cups fresh cheddar cheese curds or mozzarella",
        "Equipment": "1 deep fat fryer or large stove pot to fry the potatoes\n1 saucepan or cup suitable for warming gravy\n1 serving dish, with enough depth to act as a basket for the fried potatoes",
        "Procedure": "Slice potatoes into finger-width fries and rinse them well to remove any dirt.\nBegin warming gravy, keep the temperature low enough for a slow heating.\nHeat oil to 185degC (365degF).\nCook sliced potatoes in the oil for about 5 minutes.\nFollowing a first frying to cook the potatoes, they are often removed and then fried again for about 1 minute to crisp the outside.\nRemove the fries from the oil; optionally place them on a paper towel mat to absorb excess oil.\nMove the fries to a serving dish and put room-temperature cheese curds over the fries.\nPour the gravy over the top; the dish should be served before the cheese curds start to melt.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Fresh cheddar cheese curds (preferably less than one day old) and crispy fries are considered essential to heighten the dynamic contrasts in texture, temperature and viscosity for which the dish is known. Air and moisture seep out of the curds over time, which alters their acidity level and causes proteins to lose their elasticity. This causes the curds to lose their complex texture and squeakiness. Food safety practices require refrigerating curds more than a day old, but this suppresses the properties of their texture. Because fresh curds are not always available, mozzarella cheese may be an unavoidable substitute.\nThe sauce is traditionally a light and thin chicken gravy. A light gravy will more easily coat all the fries, emulsifying into the remaining frying oil and unifying the dish. A sauce brune which is a combination of chicken and beef stock may also be used.\nThe high dynamic contrasts make eating poutine a rich sensory experience. Even small variations--relative temperatures, the size of the curds, the oil used for frying, or spices in the gravy--can result in a distinctly different poutine.\nRestaurants that specialize in poutine, called poutineries, often have dozens of varieties, most of which add a meat topping with the gravy adjusted for balance.\nThere are many internationally inspired variants which replace some or all of the ingredients but maintain the contrasts of a crispy element, a dairy-like element, and a unifying sauce:\nReplacing gravy with  salsa, the cheese curds with sour cream, adding diced onions and tomatoes turns poutine into mexipoutine, an item also carried by the likes of Taco Bell under the name \"Fries Supreme\".\nReplacing the gravy with marinara sauce, adding either loose lean ground beef or crumbled sausage and replacing the cheese curds with mozzarella cheese changes the dish to poutine Italiano, served in several fast food restaurants in Toronto, Ontario."

Add chopped onion to bouillon and simmer for a few minutes to blend flavours.\nSalad can be served chilled or warm to preference.",

It's a great mid-afternoon pick-me-up, either straight out of the fridge or zapped in the microwave. \n",
        "Ingredients": "3-4 cups (~1 lb / 450 g) sliced leeks or onions\n3-4 cups (700-900 g / 2 lb) floury potatoes (e.g. Idaho, Maris Piper), peeled and thickly sliced\n2 quarts (2 L) water\n2 tbsp table salt or 1 tbsp sea/rock salt\nWhite pepper, freshly ground, to taste\n4-6 tbsp heavy (double) cream\n1-2 cups (up to 450 g / 1 lb) vegetables (optional), thinly sliced\n1-2 handfuls flat-leaf parsley or watercress (optional), rough chopped",

Taste and adjust for salt and pepper.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "After cooking the soup, leave it to cool in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.

A chilled soup usually requires slightly more seasoning than that added to a hot serving; this can be added individually to taste.\nA combination of young buttery parsnips and a couple of punnets of mustard-and-cress makes the classic French puree pasternak. A teaspoon of potato, rice, or corn starch should be used to stabilise the puree, which should be milled or sieved.\nUsing white pepper is preferable for color. Use fresh-ground black pepper otherwise.\nA proportion of light chicken or vegetable stock may be used instead of the water.\nSnipped chives are the classic garnish for leek-and-potato soup. When including asparagus, you can use steamed asparagus tips as a garnish; with broccoli, use steamed broccoli florets--you get the idea.

A density adjustment for 45degC was applied. \n\n| Bagels are typically made with high-gluten flour, and a low hydration of around 50-55%.\n\n| This excessive amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.775% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1.05% active dry yeast, although in all cases you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions will result in less yeast flavor and longer bulk fermentation times.\n\n| According to Wikipedia, \"Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, sugar....\"  Molasses is also sometimes used.\n\n| Important: this water for boiling section is based on water weight, instead of flour weight. This means it is not following the strict definition of baker's percentages, but instead a looser definition of analogous to baker's percentages.  It will keep the ratio of sugar or alkaline to water correct should you need to use a different amount of water, or if you wish to increase or decrease the sugar or alkaline concentration.\n\n| According to Wikipedia an alkaline is often used instead, \"boiling each bagel in water that may or may not contain additives such as lye, baking soda, barley malt syrup, or honey....\""

Do not uncover during this time, as the pohe must cook in the steam.\nStir and cook for another 1 minute uncovered.\nServe in a bowl garnished with chopped coriander leaves.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "When adding onions, you may also add fresh green peas and or peanuts. If adding peanuts, take care to fry them well with the onions.\nFor garnishing, sprinkle some grated or dry coconut along with coriander. For colourful garnish try adding small amount of grated carrot and or beet, but don't add too much, as it will be overpowering."

Scrape the wafer-thin layer attached to the stone with a spoon.\nCut each half of the sliced mango into 4-5 pieces. Each and every piece should contain a portion of the stone, without which the piece will soften too quickly.\nClean the cut pieces with dry cloth. Transfer the cleaned pieces to a basin.\nSprinkle the turmeric powder on the mango pieces and mix with dry hands.\nPour half of the oil on the pieces ,and mix well with your hands. It is essential to mix the pieces with oil first before adding any other ingredients.

Tie a neat thick cloth over it and store it in a cool dark shelf.\nOpen the lid after 3-4 days, mix well, and taste it. The quantity of salt and chili powder needed in the pickle differ depending on several factors. Add salt and/or chili powder if necessary but be cautious in the quantity. The added quantities should be small to only tweak the taste and not alter completely.

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Keep ready a reasonably big ceramic jar or a plastic container with a proper lid. Clean and dry thoroughly.\nChoose the mangoes carefully. They have to be fully mature, yet raw, green, fibrous and very sour to the taste. A mango that is very fibrous will withstand pickling until the next season without going soft.\nMangoes must be cleaned and dried properly before cutting. The pieces need to be cleaned with a dry cloth but never washed.\nLet one person do all the mixing. That person should wash his or her hands and keep them dry. No damp object should be allowed to touch the ingredients at any stage.\nOn the first day of mixing, the oil may not be visible; however, on the third day, one should notice oil floating above the surface of the pickle. If oil has not covered the pickle completely and is not floating on top, add a little bit more oil and mix well just before transferring to smaller containers."

It can be used as a sauce for pasta or meat, or can be used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes. One classic use is to spread the pesto onto slices of bread before toasting. The word \"pesto\" derives from the Italian for pestle, pestello.\n",
        "Ingredients": "Pesto ingredients\n4 oz (100 g) fresh basil\nAbout 8 oz (200 g) extra virgin olive oil\n 1/3  cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or a 1:1 mixture.\n 1/4 cup pine nuts or nut of choice (optional)\n4 cloves garlic\nFreshly ground salt and pepper (to taste)",
        "Procedure": "Preheat the oven to 425 degF (220 degC).\nIf using, toast the pine nuts in an ovenproof pan for 10-15 minutes, checking every 5 minutes to prevent excessive browning or burning.\nIn a small frying pan (skillet), heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil on medium heat.\nCrush the garlic and saute in the oil until soft, about 2-3 minutes.\nCombine the basil, garlic, cheese, pine nuts and oil in a mortar and pestle until it forms a smooth paste, or use a food processor or blender and chop finely, slowly adding the oil to reach the paste-like consistency.",
        "Notes, tips and variations": "The sauce can be used immediately, when covered with a thin layer of olive oil and refrigerated in an airtight container for one week, or when frozen for several months. The cheese can be omitted to allow longer storage, as it is the most likely ingredient to spoil. Grated cheese can then be added before use.\nIt's possible to store pesto in jars for longer periods, but it's advisable to add a little extra olive oil on top of the filled jar, otherwise the top of your pesto will turn brown as it oxidizes in the air.\nTraditionally, a mortar and pestle is used to make the sauce. The crushing action of the mortar and pestle produces a more intense flavor than the chopping action of a food processor. When using a food processor, you can simulate the additional flavor given by the mortar and pestle method by placing the basil leaves in a plastic bag and crushing them with a rubber mallet or rolling pin prior to use.\nGood quality Parmesan cheese may replace the Pecorino for a milder taste. Crumbled feta cheese also works well for a different taste.\nA common change to the recipe is to replace some or all of the pine nuts with sunflower seeds, walnuts, pistachios, or almonds.  This significantly reduces the cost of the sauce.  Besides being cheaper, it is also necessary for people with nut allergies.\nFor a creamy sauce, take 2 tablespoons of the pesto in a pan and heat on medium-low. Add 1 cup light cream and bring to a simmer. Use for pasta.\nThe pine nuts can be replaced with an equal quantity of sun-dried tomatoes.\nYou may change the taste by changing the base of the pesto from basil to other easily obtained herbs/vegetables. Some variations include using cilantro (coriander, for a more aromatic taste) or spinach (more \"bang for your buck\", as spinach is much cheaper than basil, yet still has its own distinct flavor).\nTry to mix up the standard basil/garlic combo by introducing shallots (sweet onions) into the mix, as they add a slight sweet taste to the paste.\nMix fresh chives, marjoram, and thyme with the basil to produce something akin to Valdostano-style pesto.\nAnother variant replaces the basil with equal parts of leaf parsley and spring onions. Arugula may also be substituted for basil with surprising, spicy results.\nFor another variation of a creamy sauce, add cream cheese to the recipe.\nA vegan variant can be made by mixing walnuts, fresh basil, olive oil and small amounts (such as a table spoon per cup) of white miso paste."

This was particularly the case for the vast population living under humble circumstances. Although a variety of common professions existed in the Pinzgau region, agriculture and farming were the most fundamental.\nThe basis for food in the Pinzgau region was milk, potatoes, and corn, which were cooked and prepared in various ways. Meat was a seldom culinary pleasure, even for comparatively prosperous families. Meat was commonly preserved as bacon and occasionally eaten during days of hard fieldwork or on Sundays in dumplings. Rich families ate vegetables almost every day, and fruits were eaten by those who owned fruit orchards. During winter, dried fruits were used to stuff pastries. The famous fruit bread, particularly prepared for Christmas, still reminds of that tradition. The chance for a healthy and balanced diet was a clear privilege to farmers with landholdings. In the past, poverty was the major reason for under-nourishment and consequently for diseases and infections, and almost everything was used and eaten with very few leftovers thrown away.\nThe marmeladetascherl have their origins in those times; so just try them and get a taste of former times in the Pinzgau region.",

Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center. The time it takes to reach this point can vary from 30 minutes to an hour depending on your cooking gear.\nYour paella is done once the rice is slightly firm to the bite (al dente), the paella is a little moist but not soupy, and there is a bit of toasted rice on the bottom of the paellera.

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "This recipe calls for live mussels. Here are some safety guidelines for buying, eating and cooking live bivalves (mussels, clams and oysters).\nThroughout history, saffron has been the natural ingredient used in Spain to color rice yellow. However, it's very expensive (a pound costs over US$1,500; a kilogram costs over $3,300) because it's labor intensive to process and each saffron crocus yields a minuscule amount of saffron. Consequently, supermarkets sell only a few grams per container for three or four US dollars. The best solution to this problem is to use commercially manufactured food coloring containing both natural and artificial ingredients (but usually no saffron). The two most popular US brands are Bijol and Badia. These companies sell containers each holding several ounces of coloring for less than five US dollars.",

        "desc": "Paella is a Spanish rice dish that derives its name from the utensil used to prepare it, a paellera--a flat round pan with two handles. Paella roja is a classic version of mixed paella in Spain (not including the Valencian region). Paella aficionados refer to it as mixed because it combines meat from land animals with seafood. The recipe below is based on the one displayed on Spain-recipes.com[1] but with more ingredients. It requires some time to prepare but it's well worth the effort. \n",
        "Equipment": "38-centimeter (15-inch) paellera\n7.6-liter (two-gallon) pot\nRice skimmer\nSharp chopping knife for meat and vegetables\nLarge serving spoon\nPotato masher\nClean, white towel large enough to cover the paellera\nWide heating source such as:\nStove large enough to accommodate the size of the paellera\nGas burner designed specifically for paelleras\nCharcoal grill\nLow, forged steel tripod to support the paellera over a wood or charcoal fire\nCinder blocks or heat-resistant bricks to support the paellera over a wood or charcoal fire",
        "Ingredients": "Broth\n225 grams ( 1/2 pound) chicken wings\n225 grams ( 1/2 pound) of any of the following: frozen seafood mix, fish heads, whole crabs, shrimp heads, smelts\n1 medium onion\n1 green bell pepper\n3 garlic cloves\n3.8 liters (1 gallon) water\n2 bay leaves\nPaella\nOlive oil\n1 1/2-2 red bell peppers, cut into strips\nSalt to taste\n340 grams (12 ounces) boneless chicken breast or tenderloins\n6 large garlic cloves, minced\n225 grams (8 ounces) onion, diced\n450 grams (1 pound) red bell pepper, diced\n450 grams (1 pound) tomatoes, diced\n1 tablespoon sweet paprika\n225 grams (6 ounces) canned beans (e.g. chickpeas, butter beans, great northern beans, lima beans; optional), thoroughly rinsed and strained\n720 milliliters (2 1/2 cups) Valencian rice\n1 1/2 tablespoons food coloring for yellow rice (see notes)\n340 grams (12 ounces) squid mantles, diced or cut into rings, shrimp\n340 grams (12 ounces) scallops\n24 live mussels, cleaned with beards removed",
        "Procedure": "Broth\nFill a pan with about 1 inch of water. Bring to a slow boil and add the mussels. Cover the pan and wait about 2 minutes.\nRemove the open mussels. Continue checking for open mussels about once every minute. Throw out the ones that won't open but save the water.\nTwist off the half shells without meat and discard. Put the half shells with meat in the fridge until you're ready to put them on the paella.\nCut the onion and bell pepper into quarters and place them in a large pot with the rest of the broth ingredients including the water from cooking the mussels.\nBoil it down until you've got about  1/2 gallon of broth. Occasionally press the ingredients against the bottom of the pot with the potato masher to squeeze out their flavors.\nStrain the broth and set aside. Discard the boiled seafood and chicken wings. If you don't like the idea of throwing out food then eat it as a snack but don't include it in the paella.\nTaste the broth. It should have a strong seafood flavor and moderate chicken flavor.\nPaella\nCut the red bell pepper into strips.\nPour a pool of oil into the center of the paellera. The pool should be about 2 inches from the edge of the paellera on all sides. Heat over a high flame.\nCook the pepper strips just long enough to scorch them. Remove them and set aside.\nAdd  1/2 tablespoon salt to the chicken and saute until golden brown.\nAdd the garlic and saute until it's brown but be careful not to burn. This step should only take about a minute to 90 seconds.\nAdd the tomatoes, paprika, onions and diced peppers. Saute until all the vegetables are tender to make a sofrito.\nAdd 960 milliliters (4 cups) of broth along with the food coloring and another  1/2 tablespoon salt. Mix well.\nBring the broth to a rolling boil then lower the heat a bit to allow the broth to simmer for about two minutes.\nTaste the broth and invite your dinner guests to do so as well--this is a custom in Spain. The broth should have a very lightly salted flavor.\nAdd the rice and mix well. Once again, bring the broth to a rolling boil then reduce the heat to create a moderate simmer. Frequently mix the ingredients well to prevent burning.\nBegin tasting the rice after it's been simmering for about 20 minutes and reduce the heat a bit. Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center. The time it takes to reach this point can vary from 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on your cooking gear.\nAdd the seafood (except for the mussels) along with the beans and cover it all with rice. Allow the paella to simmer for 10 more minutes. Don't mix the ingredients during this final phase. Your paella is done once the rice is just slightly firm to the bite (al dente), the paella is a little moist but not soupy, and there is a bit of toasted rice on the bottom of the paellera. The toasted rice is considered a delicacy throughout the Spanish-speaking world.\nRemove the paellaera from the heat and cover it with a clean, white towel. Then, allow it to sit for 5 minutes, which will give the rice some time to absorb more water.\nRemove the towel, place the mussels around the edge of the paellera with the round edges facing down, and push them down into the rice. If your mussels have become very cold from sitting in the fridge then heat them in a microwave oven for no more than 30 seconds.\nArrange the pepper strips on top of the paella like spokes in a wheel. Your paella is now ready to serve.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "This recipe calls for live mussels. Please read these safety guidelines for buying, eating and cooking live bivalves (mussels and clams).\nNever use stewed beans.\nThroughout history, saffron has been the natural ingredient used in Spain to color rice yellow. However, it's very expensive (a pound costs over US$1,500) because it's labor intensive to process and each saffron crocus yields a minuscule amount of saffron. Consequently, supermarkets sell only a few grams per container for three or four US dollars. The best solution to this problem is to use commercially manufactured food coloring containing both natural and artificial ingredients (but usually no saffron). The two most popular US brands are Bijol and Badia. These companies sell containers each holding several ounces of coloring for less than five US dollars.",

        "desc": "This is a simplified recipe for pain au levain, a white crusty French sourdough bread.\n",
        "Ingredients": "Starter culture\n150 g ( 1/2 cup) flour\nWater, warmed\nFirst rise\n500 g (1 pound) flour\n300 g (1 cup) water\nFinal assembly\nAbout 1.6 kg (10 cups) flour\n800 g (3 1/4 cups) water\n20 g (2 tsp) coarse salt (or 1 1/2 tsp table salt)",
        "Procedure": "Culture\nStarter culture\nThree or four days before baking, prepare the starter:\nMix the flour with a little warm water to obtain a dough that is neither too wet nor too dry.\nTransfer to a covered glass or earthenware container, and let rest at a temperature above 20degC (68degF).\nAllow the culture to stand for 3-4 days, stirring daily with a wooden spoon and adding a little warm water and flour each time.\nFirst rise\nThe evening before baking:\nAdd flour and water to the yeast culture\nWork the dough for 5-10 minutes with a wooden spatula.\nCover with a clean cloth and allow to stand overnight at a temperature of about 25degC (77degF).\nFinal assembly\nIf the dough has not risen sufficiently, let stand another 12 hours. When it is ready, save about 3 tablespoons of the dough in the refrigerator as a starter for the next time you make pain au levain.\nMix the flour, water, and salt into the dough. Don't incorporate all of the flour--save some to knead the dough.\nWhen the dough becomes difficult to manipulate in the bowl, work it on a flat surface, adding a little flour as necessary. Knead the dough well for about 20 minutes by pulling and folding but without pressing down on it.\nCover with a clean cloth and leave to proof for an hour at around 25degC (77degF).\nDivide the dough into 3 balls.\nOil three baking pans and insert the balls of dough after shaping them to the size of the pan. They may also be baked without a pan--in this case, set them on a baking sheet.\nCover with a clean cloth, and allow to rise for 2 hours or more at around 25degC (77degF) until the loaves have risen to 1 1/2 to 2 times their original size.\nWhen the loaves have risen, cut diagonal incisions along the length of the loaves with a razor blade.\nPreheat the oven and bake at 260degC (500degF) for  1/2 hour. Lower the heat to 200degC (400degF) and bake for another  1/4- 1/2 hour. Two thirds of the way through baking, sprinkle the loaves with cold water and continue baking. This will give a shiny surface.\nRemove from the oven and let cool.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Suitable flour types include complete 110 (high-gluten bread flour) or half-complete type 80 (all-purpose flour).\nIt's best to use chlorine-free water, as the chlorine is bad for the yeast.\nIn an oven with uneven heat distribution it may be necessary to move the loaves around halfway through baking.\nThe bread will keep for one week."
