        "desc": "A Yorkshire pudding is a light, fluffy dish that is usually cooked and served alongside a roast dinner, traditionally made with roast meat--especially roast beef. It comes from Yorkshire, a region in the United Kingdom, and is popular across the island. The exact recipe differs from area to area, even from family to family, so the below recipe offers a generic approach to the tasty pudding.[1]\n",
        "Ingredients": "140 g plain flour\n4 ea. (200 g) eggs\n200 ml milk\nSunflower oil or meat drippings\n 1/4 teaspoon salt\n 1/4 teaspoon pepper\nThyme (optional)\nRosemary (optional)\nMustard powder (optional)\nSage (optional)\nRed onion (optional)",
        "Equipment": "2 x 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins, or a 12-hole large muffin tin\nLarge bowl\nJug\nWhisk\nSieve\nSilicone spatula\nOven gloves",
        "Procedure": "Preheat the oven to 230degC (210degC convection)\nFill your tin(s) with a thin layer of your chosen oil, and place into the oven to heat up.\nSieve flour into a bowl, then beat in eggs until smooth.\nSlowly add the milk in stages, beating as you go until well-mixed.\nSeason with salt and pepper. Add optional ingredients as desired.\nTransfer the batter to a pouring jug. For best results, rest the batter in the fridge for 1 hour.\nBeing swift, but careful, remove the hot tin(s) from the oven, and evenly fill the holes with your batter.\nPlace the tin(s) back into the oven, and leave them undisturbed for 20-25 minutes until puffed and golden brown. Opening the oven door can upset the cooking of the Yorkshire puddings--trust the process and watch with the door closed.\nServe immediately. They can also be cooled and frozen for up to 1 month.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "For the best Yorkshire puddings, make sure your oil is as hot as it can be. Try a little batter first to see if it instantly puffs up.",
