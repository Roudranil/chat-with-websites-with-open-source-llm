The pieces should be lightly browned. Don't worry, this is the sugar in the honey turning to caramel.\nServe meat and vegetables with rice.",

The time depends on the size and depth of the dishes you use, as well as the material of which they're made. Usually, the time ranges from 25 to 50 minutes.\nRemove the dishes from the oven and allow them to cool. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready for serving.\nWhen ready to serve, remove the ramekins from the refrigerator and place them on a fire-proof surface. Sprinkle a moderately thin coating of granulated white sugar on the top of each custard.\nUsing a propane blow-torch, carefully melt the sugar topping so that it forms a solid caramel sheet. Take care to not burn the sugar or the custard beneath it. It is very important that this step not be done with an oven, toaster oven, broiler rack, etc., as doing so will invariably cause the custard to overheat and dry out or burn before the sugar layer on top is properly melted.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "An alternate method for caramelizing the top sugar layer is to pour a very thin layer of liqueur on top and set it alight (essentially a flambe).",

        "desc": "A crepe is a thin pancake. The French word is from the Latin root crispa meaning \"curled\", from which the English word \"crisp\" is also derived. It originates from Brittany (Bretagne), a region in the west of France, where it is traditionally served with cider.\n",
        "Ingredients": "Batter\n220 g (1 cup / 8 oz) plain flour\n345 ml (1  1/2 cup / 12 fl oz) milk\n2 eggs\n2 tbsp oil or melted butter\n1 pinch of salt\nOptional fillings\nSugar and lemon\nRaspberry jam and chocolate sauce\nNutella and sliced banana\nNutella and chopped hazelnuts\nWhipped cream\nChocolate, caramel, or butterscotch sauce\nFrangipane\nPeanut butter\nSugar and butter, possibly with lemon or cinnamon\nStrawberries (fresh or frozen)\nCream cheese and brown sugar\nSlivers of chicken, broccoli, and cheese sauce",
        "Procedure": "Put the flour at the bottom of a mixing bowl and make a hole in the middle where you put the eggs, the melted butter, the salt and a bit of milk.\nMix well by hand, slowly combining the liquid with the flour to get a thick paste.\nContinue mixing and slowly add the rest of the milk, mixing well to avoid making lumps.\nAllow to stand, perhaps for several hours, whilst the gluten rests--this is very important for the final texture.\nHeat a crepe pan (non-stick recommended) or skillet. A drop of water can be used to test the pan temperature: too cold, and the water will sit on the pan, too hot and it will vanish immediately. At the right temperature, the water will seem to \"dance\" on the pan.\nGrease the pan with some butter. Pour in some batter while tilting the pan to make the crepe as thin as possible.\nCook for 30-60 seconds until the cooked side looks like the surface of the moon, then flip it over to cook the other side; with some practice, you can flip it in the air by swinging the pan. See the whole-wheat pancakes recipe for air-flipping instructions.\nServe with maple syrup, caster sugar, jam, spreads, etc. The crepes can be filled and folded into triangles or rolled up.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The exact proportions are not critical. In practice, equal parts by volume of eggs, milk, and flour, measured by eye, with no other ingredients, still produces excellent results.\nYou may add a bit of liqueur (traditionally brandy or fleur d'oranger) to the batter for more flavor.\nFor a sweet crepe, add 2 teaspoons sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla\nFor a chocolate crepe, add 2 tablespoons chocolate sauce.\nFor a cheesy crepe, sprinkle Emmental cheese evenly over the crepe while in the pan.\nOne can also substitute beer or soda water for the milk. The wheat flour can be replaced by buckwheat flour to make savory buckwheat crepes, as a main dish (ham, cheese, etc.).\nThe batter ingredients above can be replaced by 5 eggs, 1 cup flour, and 1 cup milk for a simpler mixture.",

        "Procedure": "With the oven rack adjusted to its lower middle position, preheat the oven to 300degF (150degC). Fold a kitchen towel to cover the bottom of a large roasting pan and arrange 12 ea. 5-ounce (150 ml) ramekins on the towel. The ramekins should not touch each other or the side of the roasting pan. If the roasting pan is not large enough, scale down the recipe.\nCombine 3 cups of the cream and sugar in a medium saucepan. With a paring knife, halve the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the saucepan. Submerge the pods in the cream. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Remove the saucepan from the heat and steep the mixture for 20 minutes to infuse the flavor.\nMeanwhile, separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a large bowl and storing the whites for another use. Bring a kettle of water to a boil.  After the cream has steeped remove the pods and stir in the remaining 3 cups of cream to cool the mixture.\nWhisk the egg yolks until they are evenly combined. Add a cup of the cream mixture to the yolks and whisk until combined. Continue adding cups of cream and whisking until evenly colored. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a second bowl. Ladle the mixture into the 12 ramekins.\nPlace the roasting pan onto the oven rack and pour in boiling water until it reaches  2/3  the height of the ramekins. Do not splash water into the ramekins. Bake until an instant-read thermometer registers 170-175degF (77-79degC) or until the edges of the custard are set, with a spot in the center about the size of a quarter remaining wiggly. The baking time depends upon the height of the ramekins. If shallow, start checking at 30 minutes. Higher ramekins can take up to an hour to bake.\nRemove ramekins from roasting pan and cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Place on a shallow tray, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Before serving, uncover the ramekins and soak up any condensation with paper toweling. Spread 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar on each, tilting and tapping to spread the sugar evenly. Spread sugar only on the number of ramekins that will be served. The others can be stored for several days in the refrigerator for later use.\nIgnite a propane blowtorch and caramelize the sugar on each ramekin. Take care to direct the flame away from any ignitable material. Avoid the miniature butane torch since its flame is not adequate for uniform caramelization in a reasonable amount of time, and the finished dish may taste of butane. Re-chill the ramekins for not more than 45 minutes.  A longer time leads to softening of the caramelized crust.\nServe and enjoy!",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Without a torch the sugar may also be caramelized in these ways:\nAfter spreading the sugar over the ramekins, place them as close as you can under a very hot broiler. Watch them closely because this method tends to be uneven and burn. Too long under the broiler can also result in the custard turning into a sort of chunky soup which is not a very appealing texture. Works best with fine granulated sugar.\nHeat the sugar in a saucepan over medium heat without stirring until it starts to melt, then stir with a wooden spoon until caramelization occurs (this is easier to tell with white sugar than Turbinado) and spoon over the ramekins, tilting and rotating them to cover with an even layer.\nAlternately, combine the sugar with half as much water by volume, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook without stirring 3 to 5 minutes, tilting the pan as required to ensure even caramelization. If the caramel hardens due to cooling, warm over low heat until it is again pourable.\nRegular granulated sugar may also be used for the caramelization process in place of the brown sugar.\nA towel may also be placed into the roasting pan prior to adding the water to help distribute the heat across the bottom of the ramekins evenly as well as insulate the bottoms from the heat coming through the bottom of the pan.\nMake sure that before adding the cream to the egg yolks, the cream has cooled down. If one adds hot cream, the yolks will start to clot, ruining the final product.\nIt is possible to substitute half-and-half or milk for the cream, provided that a few more egg yolks are added for texture.",

Cover with a lid and top up the water level as needed for 8 hours.\nBoiling for 7 hours: To boil, place a metal jam lid, or any kind of circular, thin metal object, at the bottom of a large pan to be a trivet. Create 2 strips of large string or foil and place them on the trivet so you can easily pick up your pudding once its cooked. Make sure there is enough to hang over the side of your pot, so its easy to get a hold of. Then, slowly place your pudding onto the trivet and pour boiling water in so that it reaches halfway up the side of your pudding bowl. Cover with a lid and let the water simmer for 8 hours until the pudding has reached a dark deep brown, adding more water as needed.\nRemove your pudding and leave to cool for 1-2 hours. Once cool, remove the paper and foil and replace it with fresh paper and foil. Store in a cool, dry area. The pudding can be frozen for up to 1 year.\nTo serve, steam or boil your pudding for two hours to reheat. Once reheated, turn it out onto a serving plate.\nTo flame, warm a small amount of brandy in a pan, pour it over the hot pudding once at the table and light it with a matchstick or other easily used flame. Place your bowl of brandy butter on the table for people to enjoy with your pudding.",

        "desc": "The ancient Romans, who sacrificed a pig to their god Saturn about the same time Christmas is celebrated nowadays, are probably the starters of a Christmas tradition still alive in some parts of the world. This is a recipe for a boneless, lightly salted Finnish-style ham, popular since about the 1940s, before which Finns used to eat several kinds of meats during Christmas.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1 ea. (7-10 kg) ham, lightly salted and boneless\nPrepared mustard\nBreadcrumbs",
        "Procedure": "If ham is frozen, thaw it in its plastic package, for 3 days in the refrigerator for a 7kg ham, 5 days for a 10kg ham.\nBefore putting the ham in the oven, take it out from the refrigerator and let come closer to room temperature. If you intend to put the ham in the oven in the evening, take it out during the early morning. The ham should be about 10 degC (50 degF)  when you put it in the oven.\nUse a wet paper towel to clean the ham a bit; then dry it.\nPlace ham on baking tray in oven, with some water on the tray. Or, if you have a large roasting bag, there is no need for water. Do not use only the oven rack, as nothing will catch all the liquid from the ham if the roasting bag fails, messing up your oven. However, you can put the ham on the rack if you put a baking tray beneath that to catch drips.  Aluminum foil can be used on the baking tray to protect it.\nPreheat oven to 200 degC (390 degF) and let ham roast in the oven for half an hour. You can skip this if you are not worried about the possible bacteria on the ham.\nTurn temperature down, and cook at 100-125 degC (210-260 degF), for about 1 hour/kg (a 7 kg ham will take 7 hours or more) until a meat thermometer in the center of the ham reads 75-80 degC (158-176 degF). Traditional ham is ready at 80 degC but most take the ham out of the oven at 77 degC or so, when the ham has more water left in it and is considered tastier.\nAfter you take the ham out of the oven, wait a little while before removing the thermometer. It is recommended you do not pour the liquid from the bag or baking tray down the drain.\nWait until ham is cool enough to handle, then glaze it all over with mustard and breadcrumbs. First remove the rind from the ham, then cover the ham with mustard, then with breadcrumbs. Bake in a 250 degC (480 degF) oven for 10 minutes.\nThe ham is ready to eat when it has cooled down a bit. This makes about enough for 3 or 4 people for a week, but if you think you will not eat it all within a week, freeze the rest.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "A 10 kg ham is considered better-tasting as the pig has gotten bigger.\nThe use of a meat thermometer is recommended because the actual temperature of an oven commonly varies from its setting; thus the ham can be severely under- or overcooked if you do not use a thermometer. The thermometer should be placed in the middle of the ham. Be careful that it does not touch the oven walls. You can test if the thermometer works properly before using it by dipping it in boiling water-it should show about 100 degC (212 degF).\nIt is possible to salt a ham yourself if you buy ham from a farm or butcher or buy a pig in time to fatten it for Christmas. There are several methods available; here is one that is called tonkkosuolaus: Dissolve 1.8 kg large crystal salt into 10 L water, and cool to 0 degC or slightly lower. Fully submerge a 10 kg ham in the brine, and let it brine at around 0 degC for 2 months, replacing the brine from time to time. During the last week you can keep ham in water only if you want it to be slightly less salty.\nSeveral people swear by sauna-cooked ham, in which case you will put the ham in a sauna instead of an oven (glazing still done in oven). It will take maybe 12-24 hours for a ham in a 100 degC sauna, and several days in a 80 degC sauna. Use a meat thermometer if you use a sauna to cook a ham and remember to have something beneath the ham collecting all the liquid. Often people also use a wood-burning stove to cook a ham, this method is hardest as you can not use a meat thermometer easily with one, so unless you have good instructions to the very oven you have (or have a spare ham just in case), this would not be recommended for first-time Christmas ham lovers."

        "Notes, tips and variations": "This recipe is not the \"purest\" form, which contains only bittersweet chocolate and eggs: 6 eggs for 200 g (8 oz) of chocolate; no cream, no sugar.\nIt is one of the easiest recipes for untrained cooks. The only \"difficult\" parts are separating the eggs and folding the egg whites.\nFor the more advanced cook: use a fourth yolk (and only the yolk!); it ensures that the mousse becomes firm. However, the mixture must be worked faster, beginning with the addition of the chocolate to the yolk/sugar mixture.\nInstead of the water, use an alcoholic spirit such as Cognac, Cointreau, Kahlua, Triple Sec, etc., for all or part of the 30 ml. However, the mousse is then not suitable for children or pregnant women.\nCoffee can also be satisfyingly substituted for the liquid.\nAlmond powder, almond butter, or orange rind can also be used to add flavor to the mousse (one tablespoon per 6 eggs)\nThere is also an Atkins-friendly recipe.",
        "Warnings": "This mousse is best consumed within 24 hours.\nDo not keep substantially longer, even if refrigerated."

If you are in a rush, initially start with about a third of the liquid you need, adding the remainder as you cook.\nOnce the rice had turned into a mush and has released all its starch, a soup can be made by skimming off the top layer of liquid. You will only get one good bowl of this soup per pot of congee, and it is valued as a food for convalescents and babies.\nInstead of bouillon, a chicken carcass or pork bones can be added to the cooking water, the congee creates its own stock as it cooks. If using bones, blanch and wash under cold water before use.\nVery hot plain congee can be used to cook raw meat and fish (either thinly sliced or diced), which is then eaten with the congee. Among the traditional Chinese favourites are sliced grass carp, sliced lean pork, sliced pork liver, diced beef and diced chicken breast.\nThe two traditional companions to breakfast congee are plain soya sauce chow mein and youtiao."

        "desc": "The following recipe is quite common in most of Mexico as a breakfast item, due to the addition of eggs, but is also eaten throughout the day including during dinner time. The additional recipe for a salsa de chile de arbol will be used as the primary sauce.\n",
        "Ingredients": "Salsa de chile de arbol\n1 cup tomatillos, dehusked\n4-6 dried chiles de arbol, roasted\n1 clove garlic\n 1/2 cup water\nSalt to taste\nPepper to taste\nChilaquiles\nVegetable oil (enough to cover the tortillas to deep-fry them)\n2 day-old corn tortillas, cut into strips then squares\n1 standard egg\n 1/4 white onion, diced\nCrumbled or shredded cheese",
        "Procedure": "Salsa de chile de arbol\nRoast the tomatillos by wrapping them in heavy duty aluminum foil and placing them on a comal (cast iron skillet) over your stovetop (this does not need to be done in the oven; it never is in Mexico).\nAfter roasting the tomatillos for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, pull them off the heat and reserve.\nRoast the dried chilies and garlic directly on the comal. Caution: the dried chilies will roast in less than a minute while the garlic will take longer.\nCombine the roasted tomatillos, chilies, garlic, water, salt, and pepper in a blender. Liquefy the mixture thoroughly for a few minutes to ensure that the sauce is smooth and consistent with no large pieces left floating around. You will probably end up with more salsa than you need for this recipe. Use it as a condiment for any other of your favorite Mexican dishes!\nChilaquiles\nHeat enough vegetable oil in a frying pan to deep fry the tortillas. It should be hot enough so that when you drop the pieces of tortillas into it they immediately begin to fry at a rapid pace.\nAllow the tortillas to fry until they become a chestnut brown, just not too dark or burnt. At this point, drain most of the oil out of the pan leaving only enough to fry the rest of the ingredients.\nCrack the egg into the fried tortillas and scramble it, folding the fried tortilla strips into the egg. At this point season this mixture with salt and pepper if desired. Take this mixture out of the pan and let it rest on a plate while you continue with the rest of the dish.\nAdd some of the oil that was taken out of the pan earlier back into it and heat it up again. To this add the diced onion, and allow it to soften for a few minutes. Add the salsa de chile de arbol to the oil and onions and saute it for a minute or two. Add a little bit of water to dilute it if it becomes too thick.\nFinally, return the fried tortilla and egg mixture to the onion and chili sauce in the pan and allow it cook only for about a minute, enough time to allow the tortillas to soak up some of the sauce.  Before plating it, add the cheese and enjoy!",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "In Mexico, very rarely is this dish made with tortilla chips but rather day-old tortillas that have stiffened. If you don't have day-old tortillas you can leave out fresh tortillas until they are stiff to get the right texture.\nThe chiles are very hot; adjust to taste.\nFor the cheese, you can use anything that melts well such as Monterey Jack or Manchego\nThe recipe for the chili sauce used in this recipe is of course a red sauce. If you prefer a green sauce, simply substitute the chiles de arbol with fresh jalapeno chilies that you can also roast in the same way. After you have roasted the chilies on the comal and thoroughly burnt the skins, place the chilies in a plastic bag with a small amount of water so as to allow them to steam. After about 5 minutes, remove the jalapenos from the bag and simply rub the skin off of them. Continue to make the sauce as indicated above.\nThis dish can be made with strips of chicken in addition to or as a replacement for the egg. In Mexico chilaquiles are often served throughout the day and as such the addition of chicken strips will complement it as a dinner item. Using all the same ingredients just add some warmed and shredded chicken meat during the last step before you add the cheese.  Oftentimes, my mother would add a little bit of Mexican cream (somewhat like sour cream but more akin to creme fraiche) over the top of the chilaquiles right before we enjoyed them on our serving plate as a way to tone down the spicy heat of the dish."

        "Ingredients": "150 g of dry or 500 g of cooked chickpeas\n2-3 ea. (2-3 cups) chopped medium onions\n2 cups of vegetable broth\n2-3 cups chopped zucchini\n6-8 medium tomatoes, chopped, or 2-3 cups of canned tomatoes\n1 green bell pepper, chopped\n1 chile pepper, finely chopped\n4-6 cloves garlic, minced\n4 Tbsp crunchy, unsweetened peanut butter\n1 tsp coriander\n1 tsp turmeric\n1 tsp cumin\n 1/2 tsp salt\n 1/2 tsp black pepper\n1 tsp soy sauce (optional, can use salt)\n2 Tbsp cilantro sprig, finely chopped (optional, for garnish)",
        "Procedure": "If using dry chickpeas, wash, then soak for 12 hours, then cook 40-50 minutes until soft or for 8-10 minutes in a pressure cooker. If using a pressure cooker, do not depressurize but let the cool down; depressurizing causes the chickpeas to break open.\nCook onions in the broth until softened.\nAdd zucchini, tomatoes, bell pepper, chili pepper, and garlic and cook for 10-15 minutes, until peppers and zucchini are soft.\nStart boiling the rice.\nAdd chickpeas, peanut butter, spices, and soy sauce. Keep simmering for 5-10 more minutes.\nSprinkle with cilantro garnish if desired, then serve immediately.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "If a very thick sauce is desired, cook longer. The zucchini will disintegrate, thickening the sauce.\nIf you used dry chickpeas, use the cooking water and broth half and half, instead of pure broth.\nThe chili pepper can be replaced by chili powder or completely omitted if a less spicy dish is desired.\nTo get a stronger taste, use up to 2 tsp each of coriander, turmeric, cumin.\nAdd 2 tsp garam masala for a more authentic taste."

Don't be fooled by the name; there's no gluten in glutinous rice flour (or any rice flour, for that matter). This flour, like most gluten-free flours, is easy to find if an Asian grocery can be located. It can also be found in many boutique grocery stores, such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Other gluten-free flours may be substituted, but be prepared to adjust the amount of flour needed to compensate for variations in starchiness.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1/2 cup (1 stick / 120 ml) butter\n 1/2 cup (120 ml) white granulated sugar\n 1/2 cup (120 ml) brown sugar\n2 ea. (100 g) eggs\n 1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1 1/4 cup (300 ml / 1 cup + 2 tablespoons) sweet rice flour\n1 tsp xanthan gum\n 3/4 tsp baking powder\n 1/2 tsp baking soda\nChocolate chips (as many as you like)",
        "Equipment": "Large mixing bowl\nStand mixer and bowl (or a hand-held mixer and a medium mixing bowl)\nWooden spoon\nCookie sheet\nNon-stick silicone baking sheet liner (Silpat, etc.)",
        "Procedure": "The finished dough (with various additions), ready for baking\nPreheat oven to 350degF (180degC).\nMix the sweet rice flour, xanthan gum, baking powder and baking soda in a large mixing bowl.\nIn a smaller mixing bowl or stand mixer, cream the butter, sugar, and brown sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla and continue mixing.\nAdd the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Don't worry about over-mixing; since there is no gluten in the flour, there is no danger of overworking it.\nFold in the chocolate chips.\nLine cookie sheet with silicone mat and spoon on balls of dough, about 1 1/2 inches (4 cm) in diameter.\nPut cookie dough in the fridge for 30-40 minutes or into the freezer for 10-20 minutes.\nBake until golden brown.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "These will likely take longer to bake than gluten-containing cookies--perhaps about 25 minutes. Baking time will depend on the flour you use, since the protein content of the flour will determine the rate of browning from the Maillard reaction.\nThe silicone baking sheet liner is important, as these cookies tend to stick to the pan more than most. If you don't have one, parchment paper might also work."

        "Procedure": "Saute the onions, chiles, and garlic in the oil until well softened.\nAdd the powdered spices and cook for about 60 seconds.\nAdd the venison and stir well until it has all (more or less) changed colour.\nAdd sufficient dry cider or stock to cover, but not too deeply.\nAdd the stock cube (only if you are using cider), bay leaves, chopped celery, grated carrot and tomato puree, and stir well.\nSimmer very gently for at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally and replenishing the liquid (with more cider/wine/stock or just water) if it gets too dry. The ideal is to have the sauce with little separate liquid when it is served - but not dry enough to scorch. It may be simmered on top of the stove, or in a very low oven, or in a slow cooker. The sauce is edible after about 40 minutes but is infinitely better flavoured and textured after 3 or 4 hours.\nAbout 30-40 minutes before serving remove the bay leaves, add the oregano and the beans and stir well.\nAdjust the salt as needed, stir well, and cook for another 40 minutes.\nServe with long-grain rice, or however else you like to serve chili.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Try adding small quantities of cinammon, ground cloves and/or mace--experiment for yourself.\nIn a slow cooker it can be cooked for 8 hours. The flavour is even better if it is cooked, allowed to cool overnight, and reheated for 30 or 40 minutes, but this is a council of perfection and not really necessary.\nDried kidney beans are so indigestible as to be considered poisonous unless they are boiled briskly (a slow cooker will not do) for at least twenty minutes to destroy the indigestible phytohaemagglutinin that they contain. If you do use dried kidney beans they must be soaked overnight and then boiled by themselves for at least 20 minutes. They are then added to the chili early enough to cook for at least 2 hours. All this is tedious--it is therefore much better to use tinned ones as suggested in this recipe."

        "Procedure": "Add all of the ingredients except the chicken to a non-metallic mixing bowl, and mix well.\nAdd the chicken and mix until fully coated.\nIdeally, the chicken should now be left in a refrigerator to marinate for at least 24 hours. It may not be safe to leave chicken which has previously been frozen for longer than 24 hours, but fresh chicken should be left to marinate for 48 hours for best results. If you do not wish to leave the chicken to marinate, simply continue to the next step.\nFor best results, place on skewers and cook in a tandoor or ceramic pot oven. The chicken can also be cooked on skewers under a medium grill for 5-8 minutes on each side or barbecued (cooking times depend on the temperature of the barbecue). Always ensure the chicken is cooked throughout before serving. It should come apart easily when pressed down with the side of a fork.\nServe with naan, with rice or use in a Chicken Tikka Masala.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Mustard seed oil is considered unfit for human consumption in many parts of the world and is therefore not readily available. A poor alternative can be made by crackling 1 tsp of mustard seeds in approximately 2 tbs of very hot vegetable or olive oil. Allow to cool then use in place of mustard seed oil.\nIt is possible to make a tikka with almost any meat, the most commonly used other than chicken being lamb and mutton.\nTikka can be served either as main meal or as an appetiser.\nPowdered or dried ingredients can be substituted for fresh, but at the expense of taste.\nSome people prefer to make tikka with meat on-the-bone for improved flavour.",

        "Conversion notes": "| Weight conversions from USDA National Nutrient Database. Original recipe text preserved. Reordered ingredients to match procedure section.  Warm water was missing from ingredient list, so it was added in the appropriate sequential order.  Bread flour presumed, protein ratio of \"Bakers' flour\" not disclosed.  \"Bread improver\" is ambiguous, there is no USDA data for either \"bread improver\" or \"improver\".  Cheddar cheese presumed.  Caster sugar is superfine sugar, substituting granulated sugar. \"Bacon pieces\" not in USDA database, substituting data for \"Bacon bits, meatless\".\n\n| This amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.75% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1% active dry yeast, although in all cases you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions in yeast amount will further decrease yeast flavor, and result in increases in bulk fermentation time.\n\n| An average figure would typically be in the range of 55-62% based on flour weight, and is somewhat dependent on the protein level of the flour.  Presuming bread flour, 60-62% should work okay.  If the flour is of lower protein, such as all purpose, then use a slightly lower value.\n\n| There are many different kinds of improver used in bread, sometimes they're just minerals, others have synthetic chemicals, so practice care with selection, and make sure to follow manufacturer's directions.  Due to this ambiguity, amounts not converted and line left blank."

        "Ingredients": "500 g (about 1  1/8  lb) minced (ground) veal or beef\n300 g (about  3/4 lb) minced (ground) pork\n1 bunch of spring onions\n 1/2 cup uncooked rice\n1 cup yogurt\nParsley\nMint\nPaprika (optional)\nPepper\n30-40 grape or cabbage leaves (depending on the size, a substantially smaller number of leaves may be needed)\n100 g butter or  1/2 cup sunflower oil\nSalt",
        "Procedure": "Boil the vine or cabbage leaves in salted water until they look cooked and are just bendable enough to roll. Drain and allow to cool during the following steps.\nLightly fry the finely chopped onions in a small amount of oil, and stir in a teaspoon or more of paprika.\nAdd the meat, rice, pepper, mint, and finely chopped parsley, then cook until the meat looks almost done.\nAdd  3/4 cup of water, bring to a boil, then immediately cover and reduce heat to a bare minimum for 10 minutes, until the water is absorbed by the rice. Uncover and fluff as needed with a small spatula or spoon. Allow to cool to handling temperature.\nPut 1 teaspoon of the meat mixture on each leaf and make into a rolled, fully enclosed, package, similar to a small egg roll. A bit more filling can be used if you are using large cabbage leaves, but try to make all the rolls somewhat uniform in size.\nArrange the rolls in a saucepan, add 1 1/2 cups of warm water, cover, and simmer gently over low heat.\nIn the meantime, mix the yogurt with a bit of paprika for color (or omit if you wish to keep the dish somewhat white in color), and other spices as you desire.\nWhen rolls are done, allow to cool a bit, gently transfer to a dish, and add the yogurt mixture to coat.\nServe with vegetables of your choice. Enjoy!"
