        "desc": "Vorschmack has long traditions in Finnish cuisine. It can be served as an everyday meal, as well as a festive speciality. To be served heated, with pickled beetroot in vinegar, pickled cucumber and sour cream.\n",
        "Ingredients": "4 lb (1800 g) boned leg of lamb, cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes\n 1/2 lb (225 g) boned beef, diced\n6 herring fillets in salt brine\n1 can (2 ounces / 60 g) anchovies\n5 medium onions, sliced\nTomato paste\n5 garlic cloves, pressed\nWater",
        "Procedure": "Let the herring fillets soak in cold water over night. Dry the fillets on paper towels.\nPreheat the oven to 400degF (220degC). Arrange the meat and onion in a greased baking dish and roast on the medium shelf until golden brown (about 15-20 minutes).\nLet the dish cool, and then grind the contents with the herring and anchovy using a meat grinder. In a large bowl, add some water to the mixture to give it the consistency of thick porridge. Season with white pepper and garlic.\nPlace the contents in a baking dish. Spread out some tomato paste over the surface of the mixture. Bake at 350degF (175degC) for 2 hours. Add water if the Vorschmack looks dry. If the consistency is too light, continue baking to evaporate excess water. The consistency should resemble thick hot porridge.\nServe hot with baked potatoes, smetana, and a shot of ice cold vodka, filled to the rim.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The saltiness of the Vorschmack is regulated by the time used to soak the herring fillets. For high saltiness, let the herring soak 2 hours, for low saltiness let them soak 8 hours."

        "Ingredients": "Olive oil (extra virgin if possible)\n2 red onions, peeled and finely chopped\n2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped\n1 parsnip, peeled and sliced\n1-2 carrots, peeled and sliced\n1 kg diced venison, rinsed and dried\n100 g plain flour\n2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped\n2 tablespoons redcurrant jam\nFresh parsley\nFresh thyme\nFresh rosemary\nBlack pepper, freshly ground, to taste\n1 pinch salt\nPuff pastry\n20 ml milk",

        "Procedure": "Bring the frying pan up to a medium heat (about 50% to 60%) and add about two tablespoons of olive oil. There should be enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan when you swirl it.\nAdd the onion, and fry until soft and translucent. Add in the garlic at around this time to soften up as well. Stir in the sliced parsnip and carrots using your spatula. Once all the vegetables are nice and soft, pour them into the casserole dish.\nAdd some more olive oil to your now empty frying pan, and bring it up to a medium-high heat (think about 70-80% of max). Then, take each piece of venison and coat it lightly in the plain flour, before putting it in the frying pan. Once all the pieces are cooking away, move them around using your spatula to get them evenly cooked. You're only trying to cook the outer edges of the meat (searing it), so don't fry them for more than 5-10 minutes.\nTransfer the venison, including any cooking juices, into the casserole dish.\nAdd the ginger and red currant jam to the casserole dish, and pour in some boiling water in order to fill the dish to just below the top of the contents. Give it a stir with your spoon. Finely chop a reasonable amount of the herbs, add them into the casserole dish, and give it all another stir. Add some black pepper and a pinch of salt, then cover with the lid.\nBake in the oven at about 180degC for about an hour. After that, check it, give it a stir and check to see if the venison is cooked through. If it isn't, put it back in the oven for longer, checking every 10 mins or so. Once you're happy it's cooked, remove the lid from the casserole dish.\nMake sure the puff pastry is rolled out about as thick as a PS1 or 1 euro coin. Drape the puff pastry over the dish, covering your cooked pie innards. Trim the excess pastry off with a knife, and make some pretty decoration on the top of the pie if you want to. Make sure to pierce the pastry in 2 or 3 places to allow steam to escape.\nBrush the pastry with milk. Turn the oven up to 200degC then put the pie back in for a further 20 minutes, or until the pastry has risen and turned a golden brown.\nServe."

        "Equipment": "A large stockpot (8-10 L)\nA large mixing bowl (2.5 L)\nA small frying pan",
        "Procedure": "Broth\nAdd the shrimp paste to a large 2.5 L bowl, and gradually mix in cold water while vigorously stirring the paste. Keep adding water and stirring until you've almost reached the rim of the bowl. Don't let it spill over. Let the paste mixture rest in the bowl for 1.5 hours to allow the mixture to settle.\nSaute the small onion in 3 tbsp oil until golden brown.\nIn a stockpot, combine the cooked onion and pig feet with 2 L water. Slowly bring it to the boil over medium heat.\nAdd lemongrass, then slowly and carefully pour in the shrimp paste mixture, making sure to only add the clear liquid and not the silt that has settled at the bottom of the bowl.\nTo the residual shrimp paste, add another litre of water and stir. Again, wait until the mixture has settled before adding it into the stockpot.\nSimmer the stock for 20 minutes.\nAdd the beef and occasionally skim the broth to ensure you get a nice clear liquid. Cook for another 20 minutes, checking the beef to be sure it's not overcooked.\nAdd fish sauce and sugar to taste to achieve a nice balance between salty and sweet.\nWhile the broth is cooking, heat some oil in a pan and add the red pigment. Cook until the pigment is blended with the oil. Add to the stock. Repeat the process with the chilli powder.\nAssembly\nCombine chopped parsley and cilantro leaves with the uncooked medium onion.\nIf you are using fresh noodles, simply add boiling water to heat them up. If you're using dried noodles, soak them in boiling water until they are soft then dip in cold water to stop the cooking process. Do not over cook them or you'll have mush. Dried noodles have already been cooked.\nIn a large soup bowl, place a handful of noodles, top with a handful of the parsley/cilantro/onion mixture, and ladle on generous amounts of steaming hot broth, ensuring there are several pieces of beef and pork.\nServe hot with the condiments. You can add a squeeze of lime and chopped fresh chillies if you like your food extra spicy. It is also common to add a small dollop of shrimp paste to the soup, but those unfamiliar with the taste may not like it.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Rice noodles about the size of spaghetti No 5. are preferred.\nShrimp paste is essential to this dish, and this cannot be considered bun bo hue without it. Different types of shrimp paste can be found all over Vietnam. Some are of better quality than others. Some purists believe that only Hue shrimp paste is acceptable for this dish as it is smoother and of superior quality than other pastes, which can have trace amounts of sand in them. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find outside of Vietnam, so an \"inferior\" paste may be substituted."

        "Procedure": "Saute the onions, mushrooms, and garlic in the oil until well softened.\nAdd the venison and stir well until it has all (more or less) changed colour.\nAdd sufficient dry cider to cover, but not too deeply.\nAdd the stock cube (only if you are using wine or cider), bay leaves, grated carrot, and tomato puree, and stir well.\nSimmer very gently for at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally and replenishing the liquid (with more cider/wine/stock or just water) if it gets too dry. The ideal is to have the sauce with little separate liquid when it is served, but not dry enough to scorch. It may be simmered on top of the stove, or in a very low oven, or in a slow cooker. The sauce is edible after about 40 minutes but is infinitely better flavoured and textured after 3 or 4 hours. In a slow cooker it can be cooked for 8 hours. The flavour is even better if it is cooked, allowed to cool overnight, and reheated for 30 or 40 minutes--but, this is a council of perfection and not really necessary.\nAbout 30-40 minutes before serving remove the bay leaves, add the herbes de Provence, and adjust the salt (i.e. taste it and add more salt if you think it needs it).\nJust before serving, add freshly-ground black pepper.\nServe over al dente pasta sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese."
