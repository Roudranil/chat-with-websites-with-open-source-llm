        "url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Original_Texas-Style_Chili",
        "desc": "The original Texas-style chili version of chili con carne contains no vegetables at all, except chili peppers. If using fresh peppers, they should have been prepared by being boiled, peeled, and chopped. If using dried peppers, they need to be soaked in hot water for 1 hour before being chopped.\n",
        "Ingredients": "3 lbs (1.3 kg) beef or other meat\n2 oz (55 g) beef kidney suet\n4 chile pods, skinned and blistered, or sun-dried chiles\n1 tablespoon dried oregano\n1 tablespoon crushed cumin seeds\n1 tablespoon salt\n1 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1 tablespoon Tabasco sauce (optional but frequently included)\n2 garlic cloves, chopped (or more, to taste)\n2 heaping tablespoons masa harina",
        "Procedure": "Sear beef in a little cooking oil (not lard) until lightly browned.\nAdd the seared beef, suet, and chile pods to a large iron skillet or pot (at least four quarts), and enough water (the reserved \"pepper water\" if you prepared the pods yourself) to keep the meat from burning. Bring to a boil, then lower heat, cover, and simmer about 30 minutes.\nTake pot off the stove and add spices and garlic. Put back on the stove, bring to a boil again, lower heat, and simmer another hour, keeping the lid on as much as possible. Stir when necessary, but remember that too much stirring will tear the meat. Add a little more water if anything seems seriously in danger of burning (but as little water as possible).\nTake pot off the stove and skim off all or most of the grease.\nMix in masa harina, which \"tightens\" or thickens the chili con carne and adds a subtle tamale-like flavor. Simmer about 30 minutes more, until meat is done. Do a lot of tasting during this time, (1) to adjust the seasoning, and (2) just because a chili cook should do a lot of tasting.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Many of the above quantities may be somewhat adjusted up or down, depending on personal taste.\nThe meat is simply bite-size--traditionally, it was the size of a pecan nut--or coarsely ground, with  1/2-inch plate holes in a meat grinder as standard. It must always be beef, venison, or other mature meats. Stewing meat also works well. Prime beef or veal, on the other hand, are not suitable for chili con carne, as they tend not to remain solid.\nMany cooks omit the suet as being much too greasy, although it does add flavor.\nAncho or Anaheim peppers are recommended. For an \"elevated\" flavor, use four pepper pods per pound of meat; for a milder \"beginners\" version, use only 2-3 pods.\nChili powder is a barely adequate substitute in the original recipe, but it lacks the subtle sting of the pods. A heaping teaspoon of chili powder is the approximate equivalent of one average-size chili pod.\nCrushed tortilla chips can be substituted for masa harina (this is what Alton Brown did on the Food Network show Good Eats)."

        "url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Ossobuco_Alla_Milanese",
        "desc": "Ossobuco, when loosely translated from Italian, means hollowed bone; a reference to the large piece of marrow in the center of the veal shank bone.[1] It's a Milanese speciality of veal shanks cooked in meat broth and flavored with white wine.[2] Slowly braised, this relatively tough, yet flavorful cut of meat becomes meltingly tender, and the connective tissues and marrow dissolve into the sauce, making it rich and creamy. \n",
        "Ingredients": "4 slices veal hind shank, about 2.5-4 centimeters (1-1 1/2 inches) thick\n1 medium onion, chopped fine\n3 ribs celery with leaves, chopped fine\n1 medium carrot, chopped fine\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n3 tablespoons butter\n4 tablespoons vegetable oil\n240 ml (1 cup) dry white wine or white vermouth\nAbout 480 ml (2 cups) meat broth\n3 tablespoons tomato paste\n6 anchovy fillets, mashed\n 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n2-3 bay leaves\n2 strips lemon peel\nSalt\nFresh ground pepper\nFlour",
        "Procedure": "Preheat oven to 350degF.\nIf the butcher has not done so, tie the shanks around the middle with kitchen twine; this will keep them from falling apart during cooking.\nChoose a heavy, covered roasting pan or Dutch oven which will just accommodate the veal shanks in one layer. Put the butter, two tablespoons of the oil, the onions, celery and carrots in the pan and sweat over medium heat until the vegetables have wilted--about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and lemon peel and sweat until they're fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat.\nMeanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a skillet until it is near the smoking point. Lightly flour the veal shanks and slip them into the oil. Richly brown the shanks on both of the cut sides, then place them in the roasting pan on top of the vegetables.\nPlace the wine in the skillet and boil until reduced by one-half, deglazing the bottom of the pan. Pour this over the veal shanks.\nHeat the beef broth to a boil in the skillet, whisking in the tomato paste and anchovies. Add this to the veal shanks, along with the herbs, several grindings of pepper, and a large pinch of salt. The liquid should cover three quarters of the shanks. If not, add extra water.\nBring the pot to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for approximately 2 hours, turning and basting the shanks every half hour. If you notice that the cooking liquids have nearly evaporated, add hot water, about one half cup at a time. The veal is done when it is fork tender and falling from the bone.\nTransfer the shanks to a platter, remove the strings, and cover to keep warm. If the sauce seems watery, as is probable, place the pan on the stove top over high heat and reduce the cooking liquid until the sauce has a thick, creamy consistency. Pour the sauce over the shanks and serve.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "There are variations to this dish that use other animal shanks, including turkey and venison shanks.\nThe recipe calls for anchovies, which enrich the finished sauce without adding a fishy flavor. Don't omit them, even if you don't like anchovies.\nTraditionally, the cooking sauce is finished with a mixture of garlic, lemon zest and parsley called gremolata. It adds a burst of freshness to the finished dish. Gremolata consists of the grated zest of one lemon, one finely minced clove of garlic, and one tablespoon of finely chopped parsley. Add this mixture to the sauce at the end of the cooking, as it's being reduced.\nOssobuco is almost always served with risotto. It's one of the few examples of Italian cooking where a starch is served with the main course. One may, for a change, substitute orzo or ancini de pepe cooked in meat broth and finished with butter and parmesan cheese.",

        "desc": "Porridge (also known in American English as hot cereal), is a simple dish made by boiling grain (often rolled oats) in water or milk. Porridge made from Irish oats, also called steel-cut oats, takes longer to cook--typically 15-20 minutes.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1/2 cup (45 g) rolled oats or other grain\n 3/4 cup (180 ml) water\n 3/4 cup (180 ml) milk",
        "Procedure": "Mix oats and water, then bring to the boil, covered with a lid.\nOnce bubbling, stir and reduce temperature to the lowest possible to maintain simmering. Replace lid and watch carefully to prevent boiling over.\nStir every minute or so. After five minutes, remove lid, stir thoroughly and add milk.\nMix through, and keep stirring until fully mixed.\nServe and add raisins, sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, a pinch of salt, honey or inverted sugar syrup to taste.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Soak whole grains over night and change water. Soaking softens the grains and reduces cooking time, although whole oats still require 45-60 minutes simmering. Rinsing also reduces starch and pesticide residue. Steel cut oats should simmer for 20-30 minutes, or to the desired texture. Let the water boil out for a chewier, rice-like flavor with whole oats or leave some water in as is common with rolled oats and instant oats.\nPorridge can be made using water, milk, or a mixing of the two depending on taste. Other ingredients may include butter, dates, bananas, apples, and cinnamon. Add apples and cinnamon during the cooking process to infuse the flavor. If you want to avoid milk products, it is also possible to use soy milk instead of cow's milk. Corn oil also works well with honey and figs, out of the vegetable oils. Honey itself combines well with apples and cinnamon while raisins, dates and bananas are popular with dairy ingredients. Winter squash can be added to finer grains like wheat and millet.\nPorridge was traditionally cooked over a wooden fire and in a cast iron pot which prevents burning and doesn't interfere with the flavor. In modern times, any pot will do as long as it is thick enough to distribute the heat.\nInstant oats are the easiest and fastest to cook as they only need boiling water and as this may be also done with a microwave oven."
