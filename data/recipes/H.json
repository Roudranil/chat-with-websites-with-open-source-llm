        "Equipment": "Pressure cooker or saucepan, at least 3 litres (3 quarts)\nLarge tray (or trays) for spreading cooked beans on to dry\nBanana leaves, zip-lock bags or shallow dishes for incubating the fermenting tempeh\nSomewhere warm to incubate the tempeh at about 30-35degC / 86-95degF (e.g. your oven, with the light on)\nThermometer (optional) for keeping a watch on the temperature of the incubator",
        "Procedure": "Cooked fava beans, inoculated with starter and ready to ferment.\nCover soybeans with water, and soak overnight or at least 12 hours.\nRemove the hulls (i.e. skins) from the beans by rubbing between both hands (see notes).\nSkim off most of the hulls either by washing them away or by using a skimmer or strainer. Some hulls may be left behind without affecting tempeh quality.\nCook beans until just tender, not mushy; undercooked is best for tempeh (see notes).\nDrain beans, and spread to dry somewhere with airflow (see notes).\nCollect beans into a bowl, and mix in the cider vinegar. This acidifies the beans slightly, inhibiting unwanted spoilage organisms during fermentation.\nSprinkle the tempeh starter over the beans and mix in well (see notes).\nPack the beans loosely into banana leaves, zip-lock bags, or shallow dishes for incubating. Zip-lock bags must be punctured at roughly 1 cm ( 1/2 inch) intervals to keep oxygen up to the fermenting beans.\nLoad the soon-to-be tempeh into your incubator, preferably on racks that will allow air circulation. An electric oven with a light on makes a pretty good incubator, because the light provides just enough heat to keep the beans warm while the fermentation starts happening.\nIncubate for 12 hours or so at around 30-35degC (86-95degF) with a heat source (unless it's already that hot where you are).\nAfter 12 hours, remove or turn off the heat source - the fermenting beans will be making their own heat, and may overheat if you keep them too warm.\nMonitor periodically from then on, and remove when the beans are totally consumed by fluffy white tempeh with no gaps.\nAfter fermentation is complete, serve straight away in your favourite tempeh recipe, refrigerate for two to three days, or freeze for up to two months.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Fresh tempeh at market, Jakarta, Indonesia\nTempeh can be made from almost any legume (beans, chickpeas, split peas), most grains, and some nuts. Soybeans are probably one of the cheapest beans to use, but more flavoursome beans make more flavoursome tempeh!\nTempeh can also be made from okara, the presscake left over from making soy milk and tofu. In Indonesia, this is called tempe gembus.\nThere are many ways to remove the hulls or skins from the beans, including:\ncracking dried beans in a grain mill and winnowing to remove hulls\ngrinding soaked beans in hands\nrubbing soaked beans between both hands\nrubbing cooked beans between both hands (but don't get burnt!)\nbuy them pre-hulled - e.g. chana dal, split fava beans, split peas\nSoybeans can be cooked easily in a pressure cooker at 15psi for 10 minutes with slow-release method, or on a rolling boil for 30 minutes in a saucepan. Soft, ready-to-eat soybeans are not the target here, so don't cook too long.\nIt can be difficult to distribute the teaspoonful of tempeh starter through the beans evenly. To make the job a little easier, mix the tempeh starter into a couple of tablespoons of rice flour first, then sprinkle and stir this mixture into the beans a little at a time."

        "Ingredients": "10 oz (280 g) high-gluten wheat flour (such as bread flour)\nWater",
        "Procedure": "Add 2 cups water to the flour. Knead together until well-combined and elastic. It is advisable to keep hands wet so that the dough doesn't stick to the hands.\nCover dough with water, and place in refrigerator for 1 hour.\nGently knead the dough underwater until water is cloudy; dump cloudy water and replace with clear, cold water. In the beginning the dough can still easily dissolve underwater so it is advisable to only cautiously squeeze it against the bowl. Later you might find it easier to knead over the water, squeezing out the water, and only to dip the mass into the water to wash off the starch, if the mass contains too much water you easily wash out the gluten as well. The enriched water can be used to gain the insoluble starch, which settles on the bottom of the container, and what remains can serve as a base for grain milk.\nContinue kneading and replacing water until water remains clear after kneading. At the end, you should be left with a mass of gluten.\nDivide gluten mass into loaf- or roll-shaped halves. At this point, there are several things you can add to the mass:\nSoy sauce (recommended): traditional in the making of seitan.\nSpices: seitan can simulate Italian sausage by adding the correct spices, or adding poultry seasoning can make the seitan more similar to chicken or turkey.\nNutritional yeast (recommended): B12 found in some brands of nutritional yeast is a vitamin that is usually obtained through meats, eggs and/or dairy products.\nPlace gluten loaves in pot, and cover with vegetable broth or dashi.\nBring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer; simmer for 1-1.5 hours.\nRemove from heat and serve as desired or use in place of meat.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "To avoid the washing process you can also buy 100% gluten flour in some stores. This flour would require only enough water to form it into a solid mass.\nSeitan created using just gluten flour can be rubbery and has a very \"gluteny\" taste. Adding 1 part garbanzo bean flour to 4 parts gluten flour makes for a less chewy texture and a better flavor.\nBecause of their high protein content, gluten \"steaks\" can be grilled and fried to good effect.",
        "Warnings": "Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)\nA disposable respirator mask can help to avoid inhaling the hygroscopic gluten flour, which becomes very sticky in combination with liquid. The lungs do have a certain capacity to resorb organic substances inside the lungs, but one shouldn't try to test that ability."

        "Procedure": "Wash the apples to remove obvious dirt, and cut out any bruised or bird-struck bits.\nCrush the apples, or put them through a juice maker, and collect the juice in one of the fermenters.\nCover the fermenter with a cloth, or plug the opening with cotton wool if narrow, to keep out dust and insects. Don't worry that the fermenter isn't full, as it should be for making hard cider. With vinegar, air space is good, as it brings oxygen to the bacteria.\nSet aside somewhere to ferment not too warm or too cool (about 18-22 degC / 64-72 degF). It should start getting bubbly within a couple of days. Note the progress, so that you can tell when fermentation has peaked and is slowing down.\nWhen the fermentation is slowing down and not bubbling so vigorously, siphon into the other fermenter carefully. Try not to get too much of the gunk that has settled to the bottom, or the froth on top--the aim is to get a clear cider without too many floating chunks!\nSet the second fermenter aside to ferment for two to three months. After a while, you should see a white film forming on top. Don't despair--this is the vinegar mother, a structure built by the vinegar-making bacteria (acetobacter).\nAfter a couple of months, you can draw off two thirds of the vinegar for use, and top up with fresh, clear cider made in the first fermenter.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Use only glass, stainless steel, or food-grade plastic when making cider vinegar. The acids in apple juice, and further created by fermenting to vinegar, will leach chemicals from other plastics and corrode some metals.\nCider vinegar is better when made with a blend of apples including cider varieties--e.g. sharps and bitters, not just sweets--but pretty much any apples will do.\nApple juice that is free of preservatives can be used instead of crushing fresh apples. Just add yeast to get the initial fermentation going, and stir occasionally for the first two weeks to help encourage the acetic bacteria."

The dumplings were boiled and fried, and served with cabbage (sauerkraut), stewed apples or plums.\n",

        "Procedure": "Shape the ground beef by hand into burger patties. You should get between 4-6 burgers from 500 g (1.1 lb) of beef.\nIf adding optional ingredients, either season the outside or mix into the beef before forming the patties. Overworking the beef will result in mushy meat that won't stick together, so only mix the minimum necessary and do so by hand.\nPan-fry or grill the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side for burgers that aren't too thick. Ensure your burgers are fully cooked through before serving. If your burgers are quite thick or if you are unsure, you can cut one open to ensure the insides are browned. If the insides are red, there is a chance that the meat is not fully cooked. Alternately, you can insert a meat thermometer into the center of the burger, if the temperature reads less than 71degC (160degF), your burger is undercooked.\nLet the burger rest for several minutes before serving to let the juices cool down and not burst out at first bite.\nServe each burger on a bun, optionally with relish, sliced pickles, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, ranch dressing, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and/or onions.",
        "Notes, tips and variations": "Ingredients\nYou can add a pat of butter or some cheese to the center of each burger before cooking.\nYou can use almost any type of minced (ground) meat to make hamburgers, including pork, chicken, turkey, lamb, bison, venison, ostrich, or even a meat substitute such as Quorn. Some variations of hamburgers call for mixing different types of meat (e.g. ground beef and ground pork).\nOptional additions to burger patties prior to cooking include: black pepper, chili, Worcestershire Sauce, soy sauce, basil, oregano and parsley, minced garlic or garlic powder, onion flakes or diced onion, mustard, olive oil, cheese, butter, hot sauce, kosher salt, bread crumbs, and crushed crackers.\nDepending on the quality of your local beef, for example, you may wish to add some beef stock to improve the flavour. If you add any liquids, mix the ground beef well then squeeze out the extra juice when forming patties.\nTechnique\nDo not over-mix the meat--the burger will be tough, dense, and dry. If you mix herbs or spices in, do so by hand and be sparing. You can season the outside of the patties.\nBurgers can also be smoked on a grill. Smoked burgers will appear red and glazed on the outside, but browned on the inside. Smoking a burger before grilling it is an excellent way to seal in the flavorful juices.\nHand-made burger patties change shape during cooking, with the edges shrinking in toward the middle. This causes the burger to be more ball-shaped than originally formed. To circumvent this, press the raw patties down much thinner than you want the finished burger to be.\nLet the meat get to room temperature before cooking. This will help the burgers cook evenly and fully.\nDo not add salt until right before you start cooking the patty.\nIf your burgers fall apart, adding an egg yolk will help keep it together. Buying lean ground beef will also help, although if the meat is too lean the burger may be excessively dry. Not mixing the ground meat in the first place will also ensure the patty's integrity."

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The suggestion to flip the meat a number of times comes from a book concerning the science of cooking. The theory is that the juices in meat rise to the surface of the meat and are then lost during grilling. By turning the meat regularly, you reduce the capacity of the juices to rise out of, and run off, the meat.\nThe egg and oats combine to bind the hamburgers and help prevent them from falling apart on the grill."
