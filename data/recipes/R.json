        "Ingredients": "Chenna\n1/2 tsp citric acid\n 1/2 cup water\n1 liter milk\nSugar Syrup\n5 cups sugar\n 1/2 cups milk\n3 cups water\nAssembly\n3 tsp plain wheat flour (maida)",
        "Procedure": "Chenna\nDissolve the citric acid in the water, and set aside.\nBring the milk to a boil in a saucepan, stirring continuously.\nRemove from the fire and stir for 5-7 minutes until the milk is slightly cool.\nAdd the citric acid solution and stir the milk gently.\nThe milk mill curdle and the whey will separate. The whey has to be clear thus indicating the milk has completely curdled. Allow it to rest for 3-4 minutes.\nStrain out all the whey using a clean damp muslin cloth.\nFold all the 4 sides of the muslin cloth and twirl it gently so that all the whey that is in the milk solids gets evenly drained out.\nGather the cloth from all 4 sides and squeeze the chenna lightly about 3 to 4 times so that most of the whey gets drained out.\nRemove the chenna onto a clean plate and knead gently so that it is free of lumps, taking care not to apply too much pressure while kneading the chenna.\nIt is advisable to use this almost immediately.\nSugar syrup\nCombine the sugar, milk, and water in a large pan about 200 mm (8 inches) in diameter and 150 mm (6 inches) in height. Heat while stirring continuously until the sugar dissolves.\nWhen the syrup comes to a boil, the impurities in the sugar will begin to float on the surface, forming a grey layer. Do not stir at this point as the layer will break and it will not clarify the syrup.\nAfter about 5 minutes, slowly drizzle 1 cup of water form the sides of the pan with the help of a ladle. Water added at this stage will bring down the temperature of the sugar syrup and will not allow it to boil and break the grey layer.\nContinue to simmer the syrup over a medium flame for about 10 minutes and then gently remove the grey layer using a slotted spoon.\nBring the syrup to the boil once again and then slowly drizzle another cup of water from the sides of the pan using a ladle. remove all the remaining impurities from the syrup, again using a slotted spoon.\nIncrease the flame and boil vigorously for 1-2 minutes. Set aside.\nAssembly\nDivide the chenna into 16 equals parts, and roll each part into a ball, taking care to see that the there are no cracks on the surface\nDust the back of a flat plate (thali) lightly with the flour and place the rolled chenna balls on it.\nMix 2 tsp of the plain flour with  3/4 cup of water to make a flour solution. Keep aside.\nHeat the sugar syrup in a deep pan over a high flame and allow it to boil vigorously.\nWhen it boils, sprinkle half the flour solution in the sugar syrup. When the flour solution is added, a frothy layer is formed on the surface of the syrup.\nAdd the chenna balls by upturning the plate on which they are kept. Do not touch the chenna balls at this point as they are fragile.\nIf the frothy layer begins to subside, sprinkle the remaining half portion of the flour solution.\nAfter this, keep on sprinkling water (minimum 1 cup) on the surface of the sugar syurp. Ensure that the syrup froths all the time while cooking the rasgullas.\nCook for about 15 minutes, continuously sprinkling water to enable the froth to form.\nCheck if the rasgullas are cooked. This is determined by touch. If the rasgulla springs back and retains its shape when pressed, it is cooked. Another way of checking is to drop a rasgulla in a pan of cold water. If it sinks to the bottom, it is cooked.\nRemove form the fire.\nTransfer the rasgullas to a bowl along with 2 ladles of sugar syrup and 1 cup of water.\nCool and chill for about 3 to 4 hours before serving.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Rasgullas should always be cooked on a very high flame.\nWhile cooking rasgullas, the sugar syrup must froth continuously.\nThe sugar syrup should fill about  1/3  of the pan.\nWhile making rasgulla shapes (see variation below), always ensure that there are no cracks on the surface of the shapes.\nWhile cooking, rasgullas expand to at least 4 times their original size.\nWhile sprinkling water on the syrup when the rasgullas are cooking, make sure you sprinkle a little water at a time (about 1 teaspoon at a time using your hands) and not large quantities.\nThe cooking time of the rasgullas will vary depending on their size. Large shapes will need more cooking time and versa.",

        "desc": "Roast beef, or a roast dinner, is a traditional and classic meal across Britain, the Commonwealth, and Ireland, with the focus on some form of roasted meat, vegetables, gravy, and Yorkshire puddings. Roast dinners are traditionally served on Sunday, but can also be eaten throughout the week. The precise recipe of a roast dinner will vary considerably from person to person, so below is a broad overview of common elements that can be adapted and made your own. As a roast dinner is a combination of a number of elements, below links to already established recipes to be combined into the roast dinner itself. Enjoy!\n",
        "History": "Roast Beef has been a staple of many countries diets for centuries, as noted, for example in the English ballad, \"The Roast Beef of Old England, written between 1731 and 1751:\nWhen mighty Roast Beef was the Englishman's food\nIt ennobled our brains and enriched our blood.\nOur soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good\nOh the Roast Beef of old England and old English Roast Beef",
        "Ingredients": "Roast beef\n1 joint (about 3 pounds / 1.5 kg) of good quality beef rib or rolled rib beef\nExtra beef bones (optional)\n 1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt (rock salt preferred)\n1 pinch of ground black pepper (as much as can be held between the finger/thumb)\n 1/4 cup olive oil or other good cooking oil\n2 cups water\n1 onion\n1 glass of full-bodied red wine\nGravy\n1 teaspoon (45 ml) red jam (mix with a little water and strain out the seeds if using raspberry or blackberry)\n1 pinch of nutmeg\n1 teaspoon (5 ml) Lea and Perrin's Worcestershire sauce and/or Maggi stock cube\n1 glass of red wine\nRoast potatoes\n3 lb (1.5 kg) potatoes (preferably Maris Piper)\n1 tablespoon (15 ml) all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons (30 ml) goose fat\nRecommended accompaniments\nYorkshire pudding\nRoast parsnips\nBoiled or steamed green beans\nCabbage with a little bacon\nCondiments\nHorseradish sauce or creamed horseradish\nEnglish mustard (preferably mixed from dry ground mustard. Colemans in the yellow tin is still the best)",
        "Procedure": "Roasting\nOn the morning of cooking, get the beef joint out of the fridge, and let it stand to warm up to room temperature.\nPreheat the oven to 200degC (400degF) and place a roasting tin in the oven to heat up. If you have a spare one, place another onion in the tin as it heats up. Try and use a cast-iron roasting tin since it conducts heat better.\nCombine some plain flour, a little rock-salt and a good pinch of ground pepper. 'Dust' the fatty edges of the joint with the mixture, moistening the fat first by wiping it with a damp cloth, so the flour sticks better.\nIn a large frying pan, heat some olive oil, then sear (i.e. briefly fry) the fatty edges of the meat until they are a dark brown colour. You may need to hold the joint with a fork whilst you do this to ensure an 'all over tan'. It is a good idea, at this point, to brown the surface of the meat itself. This will trigger Maillard reactions (browning of sugars and amino acids), giving the meat a brown colour, and improving the flavour immensely. At the same time add the spare bones to the frying pan, and make sure these are also well browned.\nRemove joint and bones from the frying pan. Lower the heat, add the red wine to the frying pan, and deglaze it well. Be careful as the wine might catch on fire!\nUsing the spare beef bones, make a 'bed' for the joint on the bottom of the hot roasting tin, adding a coarsely chopped onion to the bed. The idea is to keep the joint a little raised from the bottom of the tin. It does not need to sit in the cooking juices. Add a cupful of water and pour the contents of the deglazed frying pan, including the onion, over the joint.\nPlace the joint on its bed, or on the rack, and put near the top shelf of the oven. Leave the meat to cook, without opening the oven for about 15 minutes at 200degC (400degF).\nOpen the oven and baste the joint. Reduce the oven temperature to about 180degC (350degF). You no longer need to baste the joint now.\nDepending on the way you like your beef, leave the joint in the oven for the following time:\nRare: 15 minutes per pound (~450g)\nMedium: 20 minutes per pound (~450g)\nWell-done: 25 minutes per pound (~450g)\nResting\nOnce the cooking has completed, take the joint out of the roasting tin and place it on its own separate dish.\nCover the joint loosely with lots of tin-foil, and leave it to rest for about 15 minutes in a warm part of the kitchen. If the joint can be stood up, sprinkle a very little rock salt over the top to enhance the taste.\nGravy\nPlace the roasting dish on the stove (if need be light 2 rings, one for either end) and allow the juice to heat up a little. Add the red wine to the dish, and thoroughly deglaze the dish on a high heat. This will also evaporate the alcohol from the wine.\nAdd a little water (if you are cooking vegetables, add a little of their water) and the Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a low boil.\nStir in the red jam, mustard, and nutmeg. If you are really feeling naughty, you can add some creme fraiche!\nContinue to heat everything on the stove, adding water (or cream or more red wine) until the gravy begins to thicken just a little. Carefully sieve the lot, reserving the gravy in a bowl.\nRoast potatoes\nStart preparing the potatoes about 1 hour before the beef joint roasting will be finished:\nPeel the potatoes, and trim them so that they are (more or less) the same size. Retain the peelings.\nPut the potatoes into a large saucepan of boiling salted water with a little olive oil. If you can, place the peelings in a muslin or cheesecloth sack and add to the boiling water to give the potatoes a little more taste (thanks to Heston Blumenthal for this brilliant idea).\nWhile you are doing this, heat the goose fat in a large metal oven-safe frying pan.\nBoil the potatoes for 5 minutes only--no more. Take them off the heat, drain them, and return them to the saucepan dry.\nImmediately add the flour to the saucepan and cover with a well-fitting lid. Holding the lid in place, violently shake the saucepan for about 15 seconds. The purpose of this dramatic action is to coat the potatoes with the flour and produce a rough and slightly spiky exterior to the potatoes. This will help them roast better and yield a crispy exterior. Using a large metal spoon, lift the potatoes one-by-one out of the saucepan, and place them in the pan of hot goose fat. Roll them around gently so that they take on a little colour. This may take 5-10 minutes.\nWhen they have all been in the frying pan, drain the oil from the pan, and separate the potatoes a little, or move them carefully onto a rack above a roasting dish in the oven. Don't place them flat onto a roasting dish or they will tend to become soggy. There should be a gap of about 1 inch (2.5cm) between each potato. This is vital to let air to circulate thus enabling them to become crispy.\nBake the potatoes in the oven with the beef. The temperature of the oven really depends on what stage the roast beef is at, about 180degC (350degF). They will take about 30-40 minutes to cook and they should have a golden brown crust.\nAbout twice during the cooking process, take out the tray of potatoes, and with a fork, gently turn them through 90 or so degrees so they become cooked all over. This is not as easy as it sounds, as the potatoes may have formed a crust, so work carefully. When finished, they will be crispy on the outside, and delightfully fluffy on the inside.\nThe potatoes will produce steam, so when you are ready to serve them, try and find a serving dish where the potatoes can be laid out next to each other, rather than piled upon each other. This will stop any steam they produce from making them soggy. Sometimes, laying them around the beef joint will serve the purpose.\nServing\nCarve thin slices of the meat. Serve with the roast potatoes, as well as 3 or more side vegetables such as roast parsnips, green beans, and cabbage with a little bacon.\nDon't forget some good quality (or better still home made) creamed horseradish sauce, and Coleman's mustard. Yorkshire pudding also goes very well with this dish.",
        "Notes, tips and variations": "Buying\nBest buy a 'joint' of Rib, Wing Rib or Sirloin Beef (I believe in the U.S. it is called Prime Rib, and is usually excellent) from a reliable butcher, and preferably not from a supermarket. If rolled, the Sirloin should come preferably 'bone in'. The word 'joint' is used in the U.K. to refer to any large lump of meat for roasting, whether or not it actually contains a joint (hip or shoulder) of an animal.\nA boneless 3 pound or 1.5 kg 'joint' will be enough for 4 people with some left over. If the meat is bone-in (still has bones in it) then double the weight required.\nAlso best you don't buy simply for the number of people expected at table. Cold roast beef is also delicious.  Allow for 'fridge thieves', cold lunches and at least 3 rounds of Beef and Horseradish Sandwiches in the days to come. So, let's be straight here, the larger the joint, the better!\nIdentifying\nAll meat, and in particular, beef must be well hung. At least 20 days, so the colour of the meat is more a dark maroon, rather than bright red. If a ribbed joint looks just a little shrivelled, that's fine too.\nMake sure your joint has a good quantity of 'marbling' (cream-coloured fat both around the outside, as well as some through the meat itself). If the joint is coloured bright red, steer clear. It has not been hung long enough. It may be cheaper, but such a cut will sacrifice quality.\nSupermarket meat has often been treated with a harmless chemical to make it look bright red, before it is sealed in plastic. It is difficult to determine the condition of such meat so unless you have no choice, buy from a specialist butcher.\nWhen to buy\nIf you're planning your roast beef for a Sunday lunch, please remember to buy the joint by Thursday lunchtime. Most butchers sell out fast thereafter as the weekend quickly approaches.\nWhen purchased, place the roast high in the fridge on a dish together with the bones and a quartered onion, and cover with foil. Turn it over occasionally making sure you don't drain any juices which may seep out. It's best not to freeze the roast.\nCooking\nIf you don't have extra bones to make a bed, place a roasting rack in the tin. Alternatively, you can sit the joint on roughly chopped sweet vegetables (e.g. carrots, onions, leeks, a small amount of celery).\nToo much celery will add a bitter note to the gravy.\nResting the meat is absolutely essential, as the juices, which has been drawn towards the surface of the joint will \"relax\" and diffuse back into the joint. The resting time also gives you time to make a delicious gravy and start baking the Yorkshire pudding, if that is required.\nRemember you need enough gravy for the number of people at the table, and they will take loads of gravy.... it's that good!\nCarving\nA large sharp carving knife is of course essential, and it may well need a little resharpening during the carving process (remember to wipe the blade on a cloth before re-attacking the meat lest you smother the first slice in metal shavings!)\nIf you are carving the joint with the bone in, it is regarded as \"de rigueur\" to carve from the outside of the joint parallel to the bone. Very difficult to do, difficult to produce uniform, thin slices, and extremely dangerous as often a small slice of finger or knuckle will add to the taste !!\nI suggest carving across the shortest cross section of the joint, with the joint lying on its side. It is much easier, neater, and affords greater control over the thickness and size of slices you carve. A purist may disagree, but who cares!"

        "desc": "Risotto ai funghi is probably the most renowned of all risotto dishes, and should ideally be cooked with porcini mushrooms when they begin to come into season in July in Italy. However, dried porcini (or indeed any other mushroom) is fine. Being originally a dish of the common people it's easy, and very tasty. \n",
        "Ingredients": "250 g arborio, vialone nano, or carnaroli risotto rice\n25 g salted butter\n1 small (150 g) white onion, finely chopped\n1 large clove garlic, minced\n 1/2 litre chicken stock\n200 g fresh porcini mushrooms,or about 50 g dried\n1 small bunch of flat-leaved parsley\n1 cup white, dry wine\n100 g freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano cheese",
        "Procedure": "If using dried mushrooms, soak them for at least 20 minutes in 200 ml warm water. Even if the instructions on the packet say they should be soaked for less time, ignore them and soak for at least 20 minutes. Once they have reconstituted properly, chop about  1/2 of them into small pieces and roughly chop the rest. There's no need to soak fresh mushrooms.\nMelt half the butter in preferably a medium sized frying pan or saucepan, on a medium heat.\nSweat the onion and garlic in the butter until the onion is translucent. Under no circumstances should the onions and garlic burn. If they do burn, throw them away and start over.\nNow add the rice and swirl it around in the pan until it is also coated in the butter. Leave for about 30 seconds. Again it should not even come close to burning.\nNow splash in the wine--it should fizz and steam dramatically--and wait for it to evaporate.\nAdd about half the stock slowly, one ladle at a time. Some feel slowly adding the stock is nonsense because they are off doing something else risking the rice \"catching\" and burning. Some feel it makes no discernible difference to the taste. Most would agree that this doesn't affect the taste, but does change the texture.\nStir the rice about every 2 minutes to release the starch and add more stock if there is the slightest chance of the rice drying out.\nAfter about 5 minutes of cooking add the mushrooms and their juice (or liquor as it is called). If using dried mushrooms, make sure to avoid adding the dirt that has sedimented at the bottom of the container in which they've dried.\nThe secret of risotto is that the rice should be cooked until al dente, which means the rice should have a bit of bite left, rather than be squashy and flaccid. This takes anywhere from 15-20 minutes, but be sure to start testing small spoonfuls after about 15 minutes of cooking. The rice should be fairly glutinous and not too runny. Ideally it should spread out on its own across the plate when served, not remaining in a lump in the middle.\nWhen you feel the rice is cooked, take it off the heat and add the chopped parsley, the remaining butter and about 2 tbsp of the Parmesan cheese and mix it all in together. Adjust the seasoning as well.\nLet it stand for about 2 minutes (the Italians call this the Mantecatura period) and serve.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "A good indication is a large cupful of rice per person, although that makes two cupfuls of cooked rice, which is a lot of rice to eat without adding mushrooms, onion, cheese and a nibble of salad!\nDried porcini mushrooms are almost better than fresh, as they flavour the water they are being reconstituted in with a wonderful mushroom flavour which adds to the taste!\nPeople have differing views on adding garlic. Mushrooms and garlic are a nice combination, but the garlic should never overpower the taste of the mushrooms.\nA common alternative is to add the mushrooms between sauteeing the onion and toasting the rice.\nTraditionally Italian risotto, and for that matter pasta, is served al dente, but for some people this will seem to be undercooked, in which case use more stock."

    "Cookbook:Risotto (Basic)": {
        "url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Risotto_(Basic)",
        "desc": "Risotto is an Italian rice dish, most popular in northern Italy. Traditionally, risotto is the name given to all recipes that use rice as the main component and are served as first dish in a traditional Italian lunch or dinner as usually pasta also is. When rice arrived in Italy six centuries ago from the Far East, it found an ideal place for cultivation in the Po river plain and during the Renaissance and gradually replaced rye, barley and millet for its ease of preparation and nutritious power. Its diffusion across the country gave rise to hundreds of recipes containing components of different local cultures. But the founder of all risotti is the Milan risotto, also called saffron risotto.\n",
        "Ingredients": "400 g (14 oz) risotto rice\n1 onion, finely chopped\n1 glass dry white wine\n25 g (1 oz) butter (a good rich butter is best)\nAbout 1 liter stock/broth (but it's a good idea to have more than you need)",
        "Procedure": "Sweat the onion very gently over medium heat in some butter or olive oil, without letting it brown. This is known as a soffritto in Italy.\nAdd the rice and cook until it has a transparent look (this shouldn't take long). Add some salt and pepper.\nAdd the wine. A hot pan will cause the alcohol to evaporate more quickly (and create a nice dramatic effect), but make sure you don't burn the rice or the soffritto.\nAs the wine cooks away you will see the remaining liquid getting thicker as it's absorbing the starch from the rice. When it's more or less gone, add some stock. Do not add too much stock. The rice should never be submerged in stock. Keep stirring it and keep adding more stock as it cooks away. This should take about 15-20 minutes.\nTaste to see if the rice is done. The rice should be soft, but have enough bite to it to feel the individual grains of rice. The choice between a liquid risotto or a firmer one is a matter of personal preference. When put on a plate, it should spread out slowly. If it sits still, it needs some more stock; if there's liquid coming from the risotto, it needs to cook down a bit more.\nLet it rest for about a minute once ready.\nVigorously stir in the butter in small chunks at the time, tasting to get the amount of butter right. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. This phase is called the mantecatura.\nServe immediately.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Notes\nThis is only the most basic risotto recipe. Add ingredients only at the beginning (through the soffritto, when they need to cook with the rice) or at the very end in the mantecatura (for ingredients that lose their flavour with too much cooking, such as herbs). If you want to use ingredients that require a very specific cooking time, like potatoes or broccoli, it's best to blanch them in advance, and add them to the risotto at the very end. It's very difficult to add them to the risotto halfway so that they will be cooked perfectly when the risotto is done. If you want the flavour of the stock to be present in these ingredients, blanch them in the stock. For some ingredients, like mushrooms, the cooking time isn't extremely important. These can simply be added to the risotto somewhere along the line.\nA common mistake in making risotto is to add too much of the extra ingredients. The star of the dish is the rice, and only very little else is needed.\nIngredients added at the last moment will be laced with butter. This can have a negative impact on the effect of some delicate ingredients, like garden cress.\nMake sure your stock is simmering before you begin. It's important that the temperature is as high as possible, without letting the stock boil. The surface of the stock should just be moving a little. A large thick pot is best for the risotto.\nWith risotto, practice makes perfect because there are many factors that influence the outcome. Experiment with several varieties of rice, choose the one you like best and then fine-tune the various parameters like cooking temperature, selection of the proper pot, the amount and timing of seasonings etc.\nWhat type of stock depends on the flavour you're trying to achieve, but since the flavour of the stock will become the main flavour of the dish, good stock is a wise investment. Canned is better than cubes or powder, home-made is usually best. Make sure the stock isn't too strong or too salty, as it will be greatly condensed. Make sure the stock is clear too, or the texture of the risotto will become gritty.\nUse a plump, medium-grain rice that contains a lot of starch, like Maratelli, Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano.\nRisotto won't keep beyond the meal, but rehydrating it with some soup or stock can yield edible results.\nTips\nThink of risotto as a way of making stock edible with a fork: the quality of the stock you use is the most important factor in the quality of your risotto.\nUse a different type of liquor to replace the white wine; vodka, whiskey, champagne and martini work well. Keep in mind that the color of the liquor will affect the rice. Using red wine will create a red risotto (which looks nice with fish or tomatoes). Rose wine will make a pink/purple risotto, which looks nice with asparagus.\nSaffron added to the stock is risotto alla Milanese.\nIf you are using some sweet ingredients, such as pumpkin, you may want to consider using leek instead of onion, to balance the taste.\nUsing large roasted  breadcrumbs instead of parmesan cheese will create a nice contrast in texture with the risotto. Put the breadcrumbs on top of the risotto at the last minute and don't stir, or they will soak up too much moisture and lose their crunch.\nAfter step 3 you can move the contents into a rice cooker with the stock and left to its own devices to finish it off. The end result isn't quite as good, but the saving in effort makes it worthwhile.\nLeft over risotto is not particularly nice reheated on its own. So as not to waste the leftovers, you can form day old risotto into cakes or patties, coat them in flour and shallow fry them in olive oil, making risotto cakes. This can be served with a salad.\nVariations\nMushroom risotto: Add mushrooms to the soffritto.\nCashew nut and cucumber risotto: Add chopped cucumber and roasted (unsalted) cashew nuts.\nFeta cheese and rosemary risotto: Add the rosemary to the soffritto and stir small chunks of the feta cheese through the risotto at the end. Use roasted breadcrumbs instead of Parmesan cheese.\nSweet pea risotto: add sweet peas about 10 minutes before mantecatura.\nAdd sliced mushrooms, sliced sun-dried tomatoes and shredded pepperoni before adding the wine. Add tin of asparagus just before it finishes, or fresh asparagus stalks just before the wine."

Mix well and allow to sit for half an hour, then rinse lightly and allow to drain.\nHeat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over a medium flame. Add the coriander, seeds, split peas, cumin, and cinnamon. Stir well. When the spices have darkened, remove them and place on a plate lined with a paper towel.\nIn the same pan, fry the coconut, stirring constantly. When it turns a golden-brown, remove and place on the paper towel.\nIn another skillet, saute the eggplant until it is cooked through. It should turn a bruised dark brown. Be careful not to add too much oil in the process. Remove, set aside, and keep warm.\nPut the dried spices into a mortar and grind into a fine powder. You'll find that a well-cleaned coffee grinder works well as a substitute.\nIn a small pot, combine the lemon juice,  1/2 teaspoon salt, turmeric, and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and allow to simmer for 3 minutes.\nIn a skillet, add the cooked rice and the eggplant and saute with very little oil. Mix well. Allow the mixture to cool. Add 2 more tablespoons of vegetable oil; mix well. Add the coconut-spice mixture and the lemon mixture. Mix well and serve at room temperature."
