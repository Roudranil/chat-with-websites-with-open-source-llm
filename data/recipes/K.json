        "Ingredients": "1 L (4 cups) milk\n250 ml (1 cup) long grain white rice\n125 ml ( 1/2 cup) white sugar\n65 ml ( 1/4 cup) sultanas (raisins)\n6 cardamom pods\n65 ml ( 1/4 cup) slivered blanched almonds\n15 ml (1 tbsp) rosewater",
        "Procedure": "Bring the milk to a boil. Stir regularly to prevent scorching.\nAdd rice and simmer slowly until thick (about 20 minutes).\nStir in the sugar, sultanas, and the ground cardamom seeds. Cook for 5 minutes.\nRemove from the heat, stir in the almonds and rosewater, and cover until ready to serve.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "You can leave the kheer boiling for much longer (several hours), until it has been significantly reduced; this provides a stronger flavour and a light-pink colour.\nYou can use rice flour or vermicelli instead of plain rice.\nYou can add some red soda to give it a nice pinkish-whitish colour.\nFor kheer that is not too thick when cold, use 170 ml ( 2/3  cup) of rice instead of the amount listed above.\nIf to be eaten cold, it's nicer to use double the quantities of sugar, sultanas, and almonds.",
        "Warnings": "The main difficulty in this dish is preventing the kheer from sticking to the bottom of the pan, which requires care."

The dish is named after the small Key limes (Citrus aurantifolia 'Swingle') that are naturalized throughout the Florida Keys.
