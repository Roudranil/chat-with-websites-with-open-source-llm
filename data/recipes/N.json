North Staffordshire oatcakes are a local delicacy in the North Staffordshire (Stoke-on-Trent) area of England, and so may be known to non-locals as a North Staffordshire oatcake or Potteries oatcake. These use flour and yeast, whereas other oatcakes do not. When pre-cooked, they are a form of fast food, and catering outlets in the area usually offer oatcakes with fillings such as cheese, bacon, sausage and egg. They can be re-heated by frying in butter, or by grilling. In addition, pikelets are often served alongside oatcakes in a similar fashion.\n",

Put enough batter onto the griddle to produce an oatcake about 8-9 inches in diameter. The surface will be covered in holes as it cooks.\nFlip the oatcake after 2-3 minutes when the upper side appears dry and the underneath is golden brown, and cook for another 2-3 minutes."

        "Procedure": "Meat filling\nStir ingredients together and refrigerate until needed.\nWrappers\nSoak corn husks in warm water for at least two hours. A dinner plate may be needed to hold corn husks under water.\nMasa mixture\nMix dry masa flour with paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and salt. Mix well for even distribution of spices.\nCut shortening into the masa mixture with a pastry cutter. Mix until mixture resembles the texture of tiny peas.\nSlowly add chicken broth one cup at a time. Mix well with electric mixer. Mixture should resemble consistency of peanut butter.\nContinue mixing with electric mixer to incorporate air into batter. Mixture is ready to use when 1 teaspoon of batter floats on water.\nFilling and cooking tamales\nUse one corn husk per tamale. Lay flat on table. The corn husk is roughly rectangle shaped.\nSpread  1/2 cup of masa mixture on entire upward facing corn husk, leaving a 1-inch (2.5 cm) gap along the long edge and narrow end of the corn husk.\nSpread 1 tablespoon of meat mixture, in a narrow band in the middle, down the length of the masa spread corn husk.\nRoll/fold the husk along the wide edge, touching the edges of the masa together, with the meat mixture ending up in the middle of the masa. The part of the husk with the 1-inch gap with no masa should be rolled around the outside of the husk.\nFold about 1 inch of end of rolled husk, upward along the body of the husk. You should end up with something resembling a cornucopia, with one end folded over and one end open.\nStand all of the rolled tamales on end in a steamer basket with the open end of the tamale facing upward. Cover the basket.\nSteam the tamales over boiling water for 2 hours. Keep the tamales above the boiling water, don't allow them to stand in it.\nAt the end of the cooking period, open one tamale to make sure the masa is cooked and not doughy.\nAllow tamales to rest 30 minutes after cooking, before serving. This will help to keep the masa from sticking to the corn husk.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Leftover tamales may be frozen in ziplock bags.\nReheat frozen tamales in a microwave. If you reheat by steaming, they may become soggy."

        "Ingredients": "Sushi rice\nTopping\nWasabi (as needed)\nNori (as needed)",
        "Procedure": "If making nigirizushi that requires a band of nori to hold the sushi together, cut the nori into strips about  1/4 inch wide and long enough to wrap around the finished sushi with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlap. Place one such strip on the preparing surface.\nHand form the sushi rice into suitable sized sushi bases. Generally, this means a rectangular block about  1/2-1 inch wide, 1-1 1/2 inch (2.5-4 cm) long, and  1/2- 3/4 inch (1.5-2 cm) high. It takes considerable experience to form pleasing sushi bases by hand (beginners may find a plastic sushi mold helpful for forming the bases). Wetting the hands in water prior to forming each sushi base keeps the rice from sticking to the hands.\nFor nigirizushi requiring wasabi between the rice and topping, add a small dab of wasabi on the rice.\nAdd the selected topping on top of the sushi rice.\nIf nori is used, wrap one of the nori band ends up and over the nigirisushi topping firmly, so that it sticks to the rice and topping. Wet the other nori band end with a small amount of water, and wrap it up and over the topping so that it overlaps the other nori end. The water causes the nori ends to stick together.",
        "Common nigirizushi combinations": "Broiled eel: sushi rice, broiled eel, nori band. Top with eel sauce and bonito and/or sesame seeds.\nSalmon: sushi rice, raw salmon\nShrimp: sushi rice, cooked shrimp (clean and butterfly the shrimp prior to using)\nMackerel: sushi rice, mackerel\nTuna: sushi rice, raw tuna"

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "To add an extra crispy finish, pop the baked naans under a preheated grill for 30 seconds before brushing with butter and serving.\nTo add extra flavour, consider adding finely-chopped garlic and coriander to the butter you brush over your cooked naan breads.
