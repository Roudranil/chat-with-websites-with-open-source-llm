        "text": "Cookbook:Austrian Napkin Dumpling (Serviettenknodel)\ndesc\nServiettenknodel (,ser.vi.'et.en 'kno:del) is a type of knoedel, a bread dumpling that plays an integral role in the culinary traditions of Austria, Bavaria, and the Czech Republic. These bread dumplings are often served alongside roast duck, goose, and pork, as well as many different kinds of dishes with hearty sauces such as Hungarian goulash and venison or mushroom ragout. The exact ingredients in the knodel vary slightly according to region and to season. Many cooks include wild garlic in the spring and in leeks in the autumn and winter. The version below is a seasonal standard.\n\nIngredients\n8.8 oz (250 g) stale French or Italian bread, cut into crouton-sized cubes\n2 eggs\n1 1/4 cups (300 ml) milk (preferably whole milk)\n4 Tbsp (60 g) butter\n 1/4 cup (60 g) finely-chopped onion (1 medium-sized onion)\n2 tsp (1 large dash) salt\n 1/2-1 bunch chopped broad-leaf parsley\nProcedure\nMixing the ingredients\nMix the milk, eggs and salt together. Combine the mixture with the bread cubes and the parsley in a large mixing bowl, coating as much of the bread as possible with the mixture. Let the mixture rest.\nChop and saute the onions. Cool enough to not cook the eggs, add them to the bread mixture, and mix thoroughly.\nLet the mixture rest for an hour, mixing it through once or twice during the hour. The object here is to coat the cubes with the liquid mixture on all sides to allow them to absorb as much liquid as possible; this is especially necessary if your bread is more than a few days old.\nWet a fresh cotton dishcloth, tea towel, or cloth napkin. Some cooks brush the top side of the cloth with melted butter for more flavor, but this is not necessary. Completely unfold the dishcloth and place the bread mass in the middle of the cloth.\nNext, form the bread mass into a 3-inch (~6 cm) thick log. Roll bread log up tightly in the cloth and tie off the ends of cloth with a short length of string or twine. Some cooks also tie a string around the middle as the edge of the cloth tends to pucker in the middle.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil, and then add salt. Slowly lower the serviettenknodel into the water and let cook for 40 minutes.\nRemove the serviettenknodel from the boiling water with tongs (or two forks in a pinch) and transfer to a large cutting board. Cut and remove the string; then unroll and remove the cloth.\nTo prepare the knodel for the table, begin at one end and cut  1/2-inch (1 cm) slices, taking only as many as you need in servings so that the knodel does not get cold.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThe amount of butter can also be lessened or substituted with a neutral-tasting oil.\nA wooden cutting board is preferred, as the wood will absorb much of the excess water in the cloth."

If it tastes bland, add 1 teaspoon of salt at a time until everybody approves.\nAdd the rice.\nBegin tasting the rice after it's been simmering for about 20 minute and reduce the heat a bit. Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center. The time it takes to reach this point can vary from 30 minutes to an hour depending on your cooking gear.\nYour paella is done once you've accomplished the following three things: 1) The rice should be slightly firm to the bite. Italians use the same approach when cooking pasta. They call this texture al dente, 2) The paella should be a little moist but not soupy, 3) You should have a bit of toasted rice on the bottom of the paellera. This is considered a delicacy throughout the Spanish-speaking world.\nRemove the paellera from the heat and cover it with a white towel (NOT ALUMINUM FOIL). Allow it to sit for 5 minutes before serving.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nTo save time, start preparing the paella once the broth starts boiling.\nSee also\nMastering the art of cooking paellas\nReferences\n| Video in Spanish of Juanry Segui preparing arroz negro\nExternal links\nMixed paella recipe presented by the Food Network\nTraditional paella recipes by a Spanish amateur cook\nPaella recipes presented by Spain-recipes.com\nPaella recipes from Sarah Jay"

Thanks to the high percentage of gluten in the Hungarian wheat flour, strudel became quite popular in Hungary. From there the strudel found its way into the Viennese cuisine and later on conquered the whole Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.\n\nIngredients\nIngredient\n\nCount\n\nVolume\n\nWeight\n\n\nDough\n\n\nWheat flour\n\n\n\n\n\n200 g\n\n\nLukewarm water (near \"hot\" is better than near \"cold\")\n\n\n\n\n\n63 g\n\n\nOil\n\n\n\n\n\n20 g\n\n\nSalt\n\n1 pinch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilling\n\n\nApples, peeled and sliced\n\n\n\n\n\n15 kg\n\n\nButter\n\n\n\n\n\n40 g\n\n\nBreadcrumbs, toasted\n\n\n\n\n\n80 g\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n100 g\n\n\nCinnamon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaisins\n\n\n\n\n\n60 g\n\n\nNuts (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\n60 g\n\n\nButter, melted\n\n\n\n\n\n80 g\n\n\nPowdered sugar\nProcedure\nDough\nCombine the flour and salt. Mound the flour on a wooden work surface.\nMake a well in the center of the flour. Add some of the water and oil to the well (be careful not to take too much liquid at once). Mix in a little flour from the edges (be careful not to break the \"wall\" of flour and let the liquid out). Knead mixture until liquid is incorporated.\nRepeat step 2 until all the oil and water are incorporated.\nKnead the dough until it is smooth and does not stick to the hands or the board anymore.\nFlour a slightly warmed bowl (this dough does not like to get cold). Grease the dough with some extra oil so it cannot form a skin. Place the greased dough in the bowl.\nCover the bowl with a damp dish cloth, but the cloth should not touch the dough. Let dough rest for 30 minutes (prepare the filling in the meantime). The dough should be soft and smooth.\nFlour a very large cloth (e.g. a bedsheet). Put the dough on the sheet and tumble it\nFlour your hands. With the back of your hand facing upwards, place your hands under the dough. Spread your fingers to stretch the dough, and use the other hand to pull the dough towards the edge of the sheet. Repeat this gradually until the dough is as thin as paper. Be careful not to tear the dough with your fingers. Cut the thick edges off and discard.\nProceed to the filling and assembly stage.\nFilling\nScatter the breadcrumbs over  2/3  of the dough. Arrange the apple slices on top of the breadcrumbs. Sprinkle sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts over the apples.\nBrush the remaining  1/3  of the dough with some melted butter.\nFold the side edges slightly in towards the center. These will be the ends of the strudel once it is rolled up. If you know how to roll a burrito, assembling the strudel is an analogous process.\nBegin to roll up the strudel, starting with the apple section. Use the cloth to help roll the strudel up completely. Again, it is similar to rolling a burrito.\nTransfer the strudel to a baking sheet. Brush the entire rolled-up strudel with some melted butter. Do not neglect the two ends.\nBake in a preheated 180degC oven for 35 minutes. Brush the strudel with melted butter two or three times during the first 15 minutes of baking to help it brown.\nWhen browned and cooked through, remove from oven. Cool slightly.\nSlice into individual portions, and serve sprinkled with powdered sugar.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nFor the apple strudel of the old-Viennese style,  1/4 L sour cream or slightly whipped cream, and 80 g coarsely chopped nuts are added to the original recipe before the strudel is rolled up.\nFor the apple strudel of Salzburg's cuisine, some sugared milk is poured over the stuffing in order to keep the strudel juicy.\nReferences\nMaier-Bruck, Franz.

Stop when all the butter is smaller than a green pea (about 1 cm in diameter), but you can still see lumps of butter.\nSet aside. This mixture can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for several days if necessary.\nApples\nPeel and core the apples.\nCut the apples into quarters, then cut each quarter into thin slices.

Do not grease or flour the cake pan.\nSpread the cake batter into the prepared pan.\nArrange a single layer of apple slices on top of the cake batter. Apples should cover the cake batter as much as possible, out to the edges of the pan. If you have enough apple slices and you want more apple in your cake, then it's okay to overlap them a little.\nSprinkle the streusel mixture on top of the apples. It should generously cover all of the apples.\nBake at 350 degF (190 degC) for about 40 minutes, until the apples are soft, the cake is cooked through, and the streusel is golden brown.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nCrisp apples, such as Braeburns, sweet Royal Galas, tart Granny Smiths, Honeycrisps, or tangy Newtown Pippins, are generally better for baking than mealy apples, such as Red Delicious. You can use a mix of apple types.\nYou can use gluten-free flour substitutes.\nAvoid high-gluten bread flours.\nUp to 25% of the flour in the cake batter can be replaced by almond flour or another finely ground nut flour.\nUp to half of the white granulated sugar in the cake batter can be replaced by sugar substitutes. The same volume of brown sugar can be used instead of white sugar in the streusel mixture; this will change the overall flavor slightly.\nThis recipe can be cut in half or in thirds to make a smaller cake.  A half-recipe can be baked in a 9x13 cake pan; a third-recipe can be baked in a 9x9 square cake pan."

    "Cookbook:Apple Crisp I": {
        "url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Apple_Crisp_I",
        "text": "Cookbook:Apple Crisp I\ndesc\nApple crisp is a dessert made up of a baked apple filling and a crispy crumb topping. It is similar to cobbler, which has a biscuit-like (USA biscuit that is) or cake-like topping. It is also similar to a crumble, and the terms 'crisp' and 'crumble' may occasionally be used interchangeably. According to some traditions, crisp toppings are more likely to contain oats and/or nuts, while crumbles typically do not contain these ingredients. Cool room temperature is required to create a nice crisp topping. To serve apple crisp, spoon it into a bowl and, optionally, add vanilla ice cream. It also goes well with a glass of milk.\n\nIngredients\n6 cups sliced and cored baking apples (for example, Granny Smith)\n 1/2 cup (100 g) all-purpose flour\n 1/2 cup (100 g) rolled oats\n 3/4 teaspoon (3 g) cinnamon\n 1/3  cup (75 g) cold butter or cold margarine\n 2/3 - 3/4 cup (120-150 g) brown sugar\nProcedure\nIn a medium bowl stir together flour, brown sugar, and oatmeal. If the room temperature is a bit warm, you should cool this mixture in the fridge.\nPrepare the apples. This should be completed before mixing butter into the topping. It is helpful to choose apples that do not brown quickly; Granny Smith apples are a good choice. Do not use Red Delicious apples; they turn to mush. Place the apples into a 9-inch (23 cm) square baking dish; glass is best.\nAdd the butter or margarine to the topping. Mix it via a slicing action, so that the butter or margarine forms tiny little chunks and does not melt or smear. A pair of butter knives, used like scissors, is good for this. You must work quickly once you start this step.\nSprinkle the topping onto the apples. You may pat it down just a bit.\nBake for about 30 minutes in a 375 degF (190degC) oven. Do not remove the crisp before the top is dark brown. Black spots indicate burning. It is better to burn a few small spots, which you can then remove, than to risk undercooking the topping.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nAny type of apple may be used, baking or sweet, or a mixture of types.\nCooked apple dishes are a good use for substandard apples, e.g. damaged, wrinkled & windfall.\nCrisps can be made with most any sort of fruit. Pineapple is a good choice.\nSome fruits, especially peaches, go better in a cobbler.\nRaisins can be added to the apples at the beginning, and  1/2 teaspoon of powdered ginger, or a sprinkling of nutmeg can also be put in.\nMixed spice is a perfect addition to apple dishes. This is more popular in Britain than the US."

Albanian pies are generally made of thin pastry leaves which can be rolled out at home or bought as filo dough at a supermarket. Most of the pies prepared by Albanian cooks are not sweet; instead, pie fillings are almost always savory. Thus, a piece of such a pie may well serve as the main dish of a meal.\n\nIngredients\nServes 4-6:\n1 cup (240 ml) oil, preferably olive oil\n1 1/2 packets (or about 30 ea.) filo pastry leaves\n1 1/2 pounds (680 g) spinach, chopped\n1 cup (240 ml) diced feta cheese\n 1/2 cup (120 ml) chopped green onions\n2-3 eggs\n1 1/2 tsp (7.5 ml) salt\nProcedure\nBrush a medium-sized baking pan with some of the oil, and start layering the pastry leaves inside. First, lay two leaves, sprinkle or brush with oil, then lay two more leaves, and repeat the procedure until half of the leaves are in place. Make sure that they cover the pan by hanging them about one inch over the edges of the pan.\nSprinkle spinach with salt, then mix well by hand. Add the feta cheese, oil, onions, eggs and salt, and spread this mixture over the already laid pastry leaves. Finish by covering the spinach with the rest of the pastry leaves, repeating the first-half procedure.\nRoll the hanging edges of the bottom leaves over the pie (think of a pizza crust).\nSprinkle top with oil and bake moderately at 350degF (175degC) for about 45 minutes, or until golden brown.\nServe hot, accompanied with buttermilk, or beaten yogurt, thinned down in cold water or with chilled stewed prunes. Sometimes a green salad adds to the meal!\nNotes, tips, and variations\nA medium-sized, round baking pan is recommended because it's more authentic, but any medium-sized baking pan will do.\nReferences\nThis article contains information from Frosina.org and it is used with permission."

If consumed unprocessed in large quantities as food, they are toxic to non-ruminant mammals, including humans.\n\nIngredients\nAlmond milk\n1 bowl water\n3  3/8  cups (797 ml) water\n1 1/8  cup (265 ml) almonds\nSmoothie\n2 bowls of water\n 1/2 cup (118 ml) almonds\n 1/2 cup (118 ml) cowitch\n3 cups (708 ml) water\n12 dates\n1 tbsp (14.75 ml) matcha\n0.53 oz (15 g) milk thistle\nEquipment\nMeasuring cups and spoons\nBowls\nRefrigerator\nBlender\nSieve & wooden spoon or sprout/nut-milk bag\nPitcher\nFreezer\nIce cube tray\nDrinking cup\nProcedure\nPut 1 1/8  cups (265 ml) almonds,  1/2 cup (118 ml) cowitch, and  1/2 cup (118 ml) almonds separately into 3 bowls of water. Make sure they are covered completely underneath at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. This is called sprouting or steeping. Leave them in the refrigerator overnight, and then drain the water. Absolutely do not drink this water, since it has absorbed many of the toxins.\nPut the 1 1/8  cups of almonds from the previous step into a blender and add 3 3/8  cups (796 ml) of fresh water. Begin blending. The mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can either strain it through a fine sieve by squeezing the milk from the moist mixture through the sieve with a wooden spoon, or simply place mesh sometimes called a sprout or nut-milk bag that is usually made of nylon on top of the pitcher in order to squeeze the mixture through the mesh by hand. You may either discard the pulp or use it for other recipes, such as mixing it into almond agar jelly. Wash and dry your hands, and then pour the almond milk into ice cube trays. Place the ice cube trays into the freezer and remove when frozen.\nPut the rest of the almonds and cowitch with 3 cups (708 ml) of fresh water into the blender. Begin blending. Just like before, this mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can in the same way as you did in the previous step. Discard the pulp, and absolutely do not eat it, since it has many toxins. Do not drink or taste the liquid at this point. Wash and dry your hands, and put this liquid back in the blender. Blend in the dates, matcha, and milk thistle. If you are only going to make part of the mixture now, refrigerate what you're not going to use and save for later in the refrigerator.\nWhen well blended, pulse the liquid mixture with ice made from the almond milk until you reach the consistency you desire. Serve immediately.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nInstead of making raw almond milk from scratch, you could simply purchase almond milk or use cow's milk. Just bear in mind using cow's milk would make this recipe not be vegan, if that is important to you. There is a recipe for cooked almond milk, Sharbat bil Loz, that involves a stove, although that is not advisable, as that will destroy the food enzymes in the almond milk.\nUnlike dates, artificial sweeteners usually do not have any nutrients. If you would like to substitute the dates for something else, try natural sweeteners, such or stevia or honey instead of sugar or syrup, if you can. Just bear in mind using honey would make this recipe not be vegan, if that is important to you.\nIf you do not have milk thistle, you can empty one serving of a liver/organ support/shield or milk thistle supplement, such as a 200 mg serving of milk thistle capsules, into the mixture by simply twisting open the capsules with your dry hands.\nWarnings\nDo not to use bitter almonds, since the combination of bitter almonds and water releases cyanide.[1]\nDo not keep for the mixture from step 3 above for more than 2 days, since it spoils quickly. It's best to make it fresh.\nDo not exceed 3 servings per day.\nReferences\n| \n\"Bitter Almonds\". revolutionhealth.com. Retrieved 2009-05-14."

You can either strain it through a fine sieve by squeezing the milk from the moist mixture through the sieve with a wooden spoon, or simply place mesh sometimes called a sprout or nut-milk bag that is usually made of nylon on top of the pitcher in order to squeeze the mixture through the mesh by hand.

Just bear in mind that using honey would make this recipe not vegan.\nWarnings\nDo not use bitter almonds, since the combination of bitter almonds and water releases cyanide.[2]\nDo not keep the mixture from step 2 above for more than two days, since it spoils quickly. It's best to make it fresh.\nThere are recipes that use a stove or boiling water, but heat destroys the food enzymes in the almonds.\nUsing water that is not pure, such as tap water, may have an adverse taste.\nSee also\nAlmond-Cowitch Matcha Smoothie\nSharbat bil Loz\nReferences\n| G.

Fettuccine Alfredo is an exaggerated variation of \"pasta al burro\" or pasta with butter--a dish that Italians understand better as something that would be cooked at home for simplicity and comfort. The dish became popularized in the United States and through commercialization the recipe has evolved to include heavy cream and other ingredients.  \n\nIngredients\n8 oz (2 sticks / 230 g) of butter, unsalted and softened to room temperature\n 1/2 pound (230 g) Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (aged 24 months), grated\nSalt\n1 pound (450 g) fettuccine egg noodles\nProcedure\nWhisk together the butter and grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese until it is creamy.

Between the 1910s and the 1950s he owned a popular restaurant named Alfredo all'Augusteo in Piazza Augusto Imperatore in the center of the city. The restaurant, now called \"Il Vero Alfredo - Alfredo di Roma\", is run by the granddaughter of Alfredo Di Lelio, Ines Di Lelio.\nThe original name of the dish, created in 1914, was Fettuccine al triplo burro (Fettuccine with triple butter).\nFettuccine is the traditional pasta for Alfredo and its variations because the broad noodles provide just the right platform for the butter fat and cheese.\nFresh egg pasta is greatly preferred by some over dried pasta for cream and cheese sauces because the sauce sometimes clings more readily to fresh pasta than it does to dried."

Many versions are made; some are gooey while some are not, and different nuts, fruits, and other fillings can be used. Similar tarts can be found in the culinary traditions of Scotland and France.\n\nIngredients\nDough\n1 cup shortening\n1 large teaspoon butter or margarine\n 3/4 cup boiling water\n3  1/2 cups pastry flour or 3 cups all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n 1/4 teaspoon salt\nFilling\n2 eggs\n1  1/2 cups brown sugar\n 1/2 cup corn syrup\n3 tablespoons butter, melted\n1 cup currants or raisins\n 1/2 cup chopped walnuts\n2 teaspoons vinegar\n1 pinch of salt\n 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\nProcedure\nDough\nBeat the shortening, butter, and hot water together until creamy.\nWhile still warm, sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix gently until a dough forms. Try not to knead it while forming it into a large ball.\nSeparate the dough into two equal portions and chill 20 to 40 minutes.\nDivide the dough into two dozen equal balls. Roll each ball into a flat disc.\nTarts\nPreheat oven to 350degF (175@C).\nBeat the eggs well. Add sugar, syrup, and melted butter and beat again.\nAdd the currants, walnuts, vinegar, salt, and vanilla extract and mix vigorously.\nPut a small amount of cornmeal into small tartlet pans, or count out 24 cupcake papers.\nFit the flat circles of pie crust into the pans, or fit them into cupcake papers and insert them into the pans.\nFill the shells  2/3  full with the prepared filling.\nBake until the pastry is light brown (about 20 minutes).\nRemove from the oven and let cool.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nFor runnier tarts, cook for 15 to 17 minutes. You can also adjust the filling ingredients to 1 cup of corn syrup and 1 cup of brown sugar.\nTry replacing the currants with coconut, or omit entirely.\nTry replacing the walnuts with pecans, or omit entirely.\nTry drizzling 4 oz (120 g) melted chocolate over the cooked tarts.\nThis recipe (both the tarts and the pie crust) is a century-old recipe from rural North Western Ontario.\nIf the top of the tart hasn't frothed while baking and formed a cream coloured crunchy top it means there was too much time between when you beat the mixture and when it started baking. If you have to do multiple batched in the oven with the same mixture be sure to keep it cool and keep stirring it to make sure the second batch has the traditional crispy top.\nLinks\nRecipe source: http://www.boutell.com/vegetarian/butter-tarts.html"

Add 1 teaspoon of sugar. Let it rest for a moment, as yeast in general needs some time to ferment.\nWhen ready, add the yeast mixture to the bowl with the flour. Put the remaining sugar into the bowl. Make sure the mixture has reached at least room temperature, then mix in the eggs and a pinch of salt. Finally, add ground lemon peel.\nKnead it until you get nice, smooth dough.\nUse a cloth to cover the bowl. Let it rest until the dough has risen significantly.\nIn the meantime, thoroughly oil or butter a baking pan, preferably of about 5 to 10 cm height.\nWhen ready, take the dough and put it on a clean, floured surface. Roll the dough to 1 cm thickness. Divide it so that you get equal squares of about 4 x 4 square centimeters each.\nTop each square with a dollop of jam. Pinch together the 4 corners of the square to enclose the filling, then roll the bun in your hands to round it out.\nPlace the buns side-by-side in the greased pan. Cover them with a cloth once more, and let them rest for 20 minutes.\nBake the buns in a preheated oven until they are golden brown.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nTry dusting the buns with some powdered sugar.\nFor extra flavor, you may also serve them with some vanilla sauce.\nConversion notes\n| Original weight-based recipe given in grams. Ingredient order preserved. Flour presumed as all purpose. Yeast type presumed as fresh compressed. Pinch defined as 1/16 tsp.  Lemon was ambiguous, procedure texts suggests it and parenthetical means 1 lemon peel only, 1 lemon presumed to have 2 tsp of peel (minus pith).  Milk, jam, and pan oil amounts unknown.\n\n| Volumetric values are approximate, and were calculated from USDA National Nutrient Database data. To conserve column space, tablespoons were abbreviated as \"T\", and teaspoons as \"t\". \n\n| This excessive amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.75% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1% active dry yeast, although you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions will reduce yeast flavor even more, and those same reductions will result in longer times to rise during bulk ferment.\n\n| A typical water amount would be 50-70% (based on flour weight), likely 57-62% depending on protein of flour, so 60% is a single average figure to work with.  Eggs are 76% water, so 20% * 76% = 15.2%, which is the amount of water eggs have contributed.  Butter is about 16% water, so 24% * 16% = 3.84%, or about 4%. 60% - 15% - 4% = 41%. Whole milk is about 88% water.  41% / 88%  46.59%.  Thus, baker's % whole milk value should be somewhere around the value of 47%. Values to try would be in the approximate range of 37-57%."

        "text": "Cookbook:Fudge Brownies\ndesc\nFudge brownies are dark, dense, fudge-like brownies. They contain more cocoa than cake-like brownies and as a result they are slightly more bitter and have a more \"dark chocolate\" taste.\n\nIngredients\n110 g (1.2 dl or  1/2 cup or 4 oz) flour\n110 g (1.2 dl or  1/2 cup or 4 oz) unsalted butter\n280 g (3 dl or 1  1/4 cups or 10 oz) granulated sugar\n2 large, cold eggs\n170 g (1.8 dl or  3/4 cup or 6 oz) cocoa\n 1/4 tsp salt\n1 tsp vanilla essence\nProcedure\nPreheat oven to 160degC (325degF or Gas Mark 3).\nIn a saucepan, melt butter over low heat.\nSlowly stir in sugar, making sure it is completely dissolved. Stir in cocoa, then remove from heat and add vanilla.\nStir in salt and mix until even.\nWhisk eggs together in a separate bowl, then add to the mixture and stir well.\nAdd flour and stir until all of the flour is incorporated and the batter is an even color. Stir well for at least another 50 strokes.\nPour into an 8x8-inch pan lined with aluminum foil, leaving plenty of overhang on both sides.\nBake for about 26 minutes--the time varies depending on your pan type and your individual oven.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nFor the best results, refrigerate the brownies until they are cooled completely. Use the foil hanging over the edges as handles to remove the baked brownies from the pan (this requires some care as the brownies are not solid at this point). Fold the foil over the top so that the brownies are covered top and bottom with foil, and then put the whole thing in the refrigerator until cooled (feel the bottom center if you aren't sure). This prevents the edges from overcooking while allowing the center to finish baking and cool. If you omit this step, you may end up with an undercooked center and/or overcooked edges.\nFor the real chocolate lover, crumble about 50 grams (1 3/4 ounces) of a dark chocolate bar (one with about 70% cocoa content) into the batter and stir it lightly right before pouring the mixture into the baking pan. You may need to add a few minutes to the baking time.\nCut a brownie in half lengthwise and eat it with ice cream in the middle like an ice cream sandwich.\nInstead of adding vanilla and/or nuts, try adding about 100 grams (4 oz) of fresh raspberries; their sharpness goes very well with the richness of the chocolate. Half fill the tin with batter, sprinkle the raspberries over the mixture, then pour on the rest."

        "text": "Cookbook:Boeuf Bourguignon\ndesc\nBoeuf bourguignon (French for Burgundy beef) is a well known, traditional French stew prepared with beef braised in red wine (originally Burgundy wine) and beef broth, flavored with garlic, onions, carrots, a bouquet garni and garnished with mushrooms.[1] It is one of many examples of peasant dishes slowly evolving into haute cuisine. Most likely, the method of slowly simmering beef in wine originated as a means of tenderizing cuts of meat that were too tough to cook any other way. Also, simmering these two ingredients together helps to create a unique and pleasant flavor.\n\nIngredients\n1 kg beef (blade steak or stewing shoulder cut)\n3 large onions, chopped\n1-2 cloves of garlic\n300 g of chopped carrot\n300 g of button mushrooms\nBouquet of herbs: basil, rosemary and thyme tied with string\n2-4 cups of red wine\nSalt\nPepper\nOlive oil\nFlour\nPreparation\nCut beef into large, 5 cm chunks. Season with salt, pepper and olive oil.\nCook beef a small amount at a time in a dutch oven or large saucepan until it's golden brown on the outside. Remove each portion as it's done and set aside.\nAdd onions and garlic to the same pot and cook till golden brown.\nSprinkle with 2 tablespoons of flour. Cook a few minutes longer.\nAdd 1-2 cups of red wine.\nBring wine to a boil then simmer for 5 minutes.\nAdd beef, carrots, herbs, and mushrooms.\nAdd another couple cups of red wine and water (enough to cover the meat and vegetables).\nCook for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove surface scum as required.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nUse leftovers to make meat pies or puff pastries.\nAdd a small amount of dried Trompettes de la mort (Craterellus cornucopioides). For a dish serving 4, 4 trompettes can be used depending on taste. Cut off parts that may contain sand, rinse, cut in small pieces, soak for 5 minutes in warm water and add to the dish after adding the wine. Can be used instead of garlic.\nUse a low-fat cut of beef and serve with boiled potatoes or steamed rice on the side to lower the fat and calories of this dish.\nReferences\n| A copy of Julia Child's boeuf bourguignon recipe from her book Mastering the art of French Cooking posted on the Knopf Doubleday website\n\n| Info and history on boeuf bourguignon on the Saltlake magazine website"

        "text": "Cookbook:Beef and Guinness Casserole\ndesc\nHere is a recipe for a fantastic beef and Guinness casserole. You can find many variations of this by searching the internet, but I found many of them lacking so I experimented and experimented. Finally it started tasting deep and rich. Serves four (or three if you're my family---they can't get enough!).\n\nIngredients\nCasserole\n1 kg (2.5 lbs) of round beef\n4-5 medium onions\n4-5 stalks of celery\n4-5 medium carrots\n1 bottle (500 ml) Guinness or other stout\n500 ml (16 oz) of tomato sauce (can use canned chopped tomato, but for a richer sauce use bottles of tomato sauce. Do NOT use ketchup!)\n1 small handful of fresh thyme\n2 cloves of garlic, crushed and sliced thin\n2 bay leaves\n 1/4 cup of plain flour\n2 tablespoons of peppercorns (can add more to taste)\n1 teaspoon of salt\nApproximately 1 litre (1 quart) of stock\nOlive oil\nChamp\n1 bunch of spring onion\nStarchy white potatoes (enough for 4 people)\nButter\nMilk\nProcedure\nTrim the meat of excess fat, and cut into 1-inch pieces.\nCut your vegetables into small, similarly sized pieces. Keep the carrots big enough (about  1/2-inch cuts), and none so big as you wouldn't want to find it later and think \"that's a bloody big bit of carrot\".\nFreshly grind your pepper to a fine powder in a pestle and mortar. Take your time with this. Then add a teaspoon of salt, and set half of this aside for your champ potato. Then add the other half to the  1/4 cup of flour and mix well to get seasoned flour. Then mix this in a big bowl with your beef.\nHeat your frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a good lug of olive oil, then add your coated beef (discard the excess coating, which shouldn't be much). You need enough oil so that the coating isn't dry on the beef. You then want to brown the beef--keep it moving so it doesn't burn. What you're doing is sealing the meat so it's tender and undergoing the Mailliard reaction, which give fantastic flavour. Brown in batches if pan is not very large. Put to one side.\nAdd another small glug of olive oil to the pan. Add the onion and turn to medium-low heat. Cook for a few minutes, add celery and garlic, and continue to cook until they all soften and the onion has started going golden. Add the carrot and continue for another few minutes.\nNow get a big oven-proof casserole dish, and add your stock, cooked vegetables, beef, Guinness, tomato, bay leaves and thyme. Bring to boil on a hob, put on the lid, and put into a preheated oven at 150degC (300degF) convection. Check every 40 minutes to 1 hour, and give a good stir. This takes 3 hours to cook properly. All the protein that makes round beef tough comes out into your sauce to make it thick and rich and your beef juicy and tender. If you did the browning part right, the beef should be succulent and bursting with flavour--if not then it is dry and boring.\nAbout 40 minutes before the casserole is done, boil the potatoes until soft. Drain, and allow to steam until dry. Mash thoroughly and add pepper/salt combo (salt to taste), butter, and a little milk--its amazing how little milk will turn your potato to sludge, so be careful. Once all this is mashed well, stir in your spring onion.\nServe in deep bowls. Put a layer of champ at the bottom, ladle your beef and Guinness on the top, serve, and enjoy."

        "text": "Cookbook:Bangladesh Curry\ndesc\nTo prepare this curry, you make a sauce from vegetables and spices first, then add the meat and stew it. The sauce is then thickened with yoghurt, and the sweetness of the curry is balanced with a little sour lime juice.\n\nIngredients\n4-6 medium tomatoes\n1 medium onion\n4 tbsp vegetable oil\n3 cm (1-inch) piece ginger root\n2 garlic cloves\n1-2 mild green chillies\n1 tsp ground coriander\n1 tsp ground cumin\n 1/4 tsp ground turmeric\nSalt\nFreshly-ground black pepper\n100 ml (3 1/2 fl oz) water\n1 free-range chicken, jointed into 8 pieces, or 8 thighs and/or drumsticks\n2 tbsp yoghurt\n1 lime (or lemon)\n1 small bunch of coriander leaves\nCooked rice, to serve\nProcedure\nTo skin the tomatoes, nick the skin of each tomato with the point of a sharp knife, then put the tomatoes in a bowl next to the sink and pour over some very hot water from the kettle to cover. Count to 20, then carefully pour away the water. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, peel away the skin, halve the tomatoes, squeeze out most of the pips and juice into an empty bowl, and discard. Chop the flesh roughly and put it down on a plate to one side.\nPeel and finely chop the onion. Fry the onion in the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over low to medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time so that it turns an even golden brown. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn't burn.\nMeanwhile, peel and finely chop the ginger and the garlic.\nSlit the chilli using a sharp knife. Slice the flesh away from the cluster of seeds in the middle. Avoid touching any part of the chilli with your fingers if you can, as it is very easy to get chilli in your eyes, and that will sting. You can use a fork to hold the chilli down or wear rubber gloves. Chop the chilli finely.\nMeasure the ground spices into a teacup. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli to the pan, stir them around and fry for another minute or so. If you want your curry to be hot as well as spicy, include some or all of the chilli seeds. Then add the spices in the cup into the onions. Fry the spices for a minute or two, stirring all the time so that they do not stick. Add some salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nPour in the water and the tomatoes, bring to the boil, turn down the heat a little and let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes.\nAdd the chicken pieces to the pan and stir them around so they are covered with the sauce. Put the lid on the pan, turn the heat down and let the chicken cook for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Chicken thighs will take longer to cook than breast pieces.\nNow add the yoghurt to the chicken and stir it in. When the sauce is gently bubbling again, scoop up a little in a teaspoon, blow it cool and taste it. The sauce will probably taste quite sweet because of the tomatoes. Cut the lime in half and squeeze its juice into the sauce. Stir and taste again, and decide whether you want to add the second half.\nFinally, chop the fresh coriander leaves and sprinkle them on to the curry just before you serve it with the rice."

        "text": "Cookbook:Baozi (Steamed Yeasted Dumplings)\ndesc\nA baozi, also known as bao or bau, is a type of steamed, filled bun or\nbread-like item in Chinese cuisine. In its bun-like aspect it is very similar to the traditional Chinese mantou, but baozi has filling. It can be filled with meat or vegetarian fillings, and used as an alternative to rice or noodles. It can be eaten at any meal in Chinese culture, and is often eaten for breakfast.\n\nIngredients\nIngredient\n\nCount\n\nVolume\n[note 1]\n\n\nWeight\n\nBaker's %\n\n\nWarm water (around body temperature-100degF or 38degC)\n\n\n\n200-250 ml (1 cup)\n\n198-248 g\n\n44-55%\n\n\nActive dry yeast [note 2]\n\n1 packet\n\n3 tsp\n\n7.2-12 g\n\n\n\n\nGranulated white sugar\n\n\n\n2 tbsp\n\n25.2 g\n\n5.60%\n\n\nWhite bread flour, plus extra for flouring hands, surfaces, etc.\n\n\n\n3  1/2 cups\n\n450 g\n\n100%\n\n\nDouble-acting baking powder\n\n\n\n1 tsp\n\n4.6 g\n\n1.02%\n\n\nSalt (optional)\n\n\n\n 1/2 tsp\n\n3 g\n\n0.67%\n\n\nSesame oil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilling, as desired (see notes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n688-743 g\n\n153-165%\nProcedure\nDough\nStir yeast and 1 tablespoon of sugar into 1 cup of the warm water. Let stand for 15 minutes. Skip this step if your yeast does not need proofing (it will say so on the packet).\nSift the flour and sugar together.\nIf you pre-mixed the yeast, add to the flour and the rest of the sugar in a mixing bowl.\nIf you didn't pre-mix the yeast, mix flour, salt if desired, and the sugar, then mix in yeast in a mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of the water in a steady stream, mixing constantly.\nMix together. The dough will begin to form a ragged clump. If the dough does not stick together, add a small amount more water.\nKnead dough for 5-10 minutes. The dough will stiffen, and should spring back slowly when indented with a finger. The surface should be smooth and slightly shiny.\nCoat the bottom of a large bowl with the sesame oil to give a thin film, and place the dough in the bowl. Roll over so it is coated with the oil.\nAllow dough to rise and double in volume in a warm place for 1-1 1/2 hours, or in a cool place like a fridge for 2-3 hours. A slow rise in a cool place will produce a finer texture.\nPunch dough down. If you wish at this point, you can allow it to rise and double again, in a warm or cool place, and punch down again. A double rise also results in a finer, more tender texture.\nForm into a large pancake shape.\nSprinkle the baking powder evenly across the dough, and knead again, until the same consistency as before it rose. Water from the yeast's respiration may have made the dough softer, so add a bit more flour if needed.\nDivide the dough into two long rolls, and cut each into 6 pieces.\nRoll each piece of dough into a ball. If you are making plain baozi, go straight to Step 20 now. If making filled baozi, then flatten each ball into a 6-inch (15 cm) disc.\nShape the disc so that it is significantly thicker in the centre than at the edges.\nPosition one hand as if you were holding a normal drinking glass, and place a disc of dough over the top.\nUsing two fingers, push the centre of the disc down by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).\nPlace 1 dessert spoon of filling into the well you just made in the dough.\nStill holding your hand in position, use your other hand to fold the edges of the dough together, in a sort of pleated fashion.\nPinch edges together and twist (so that you twist a small portion at the top right off) to close the baozi.\nPlace each baozi on a square of parchment paper, 3 inches (7.5 cm) to a side.\nAllow to rise in warm place 1 hour. The dough should end up springy to the touch.\nCooking\nPlace buns in a steamer. Try to position so they do not touch one another. It will almost certainly require several batches to steam all the buns, unless you have lots of steamers, or a very big one. You can put them seam up (opening flower effect) or seam down (smooth, round top).\nSteam buns over gently boiling water for 10-15 minutes.\nAfter this time, remove the pan and steamer from heat, but don't remove the steamer from the pan, or lift the lid of the steamer. By allowing the steam to subside gradually like this, you prevent the dough from collapsing on contact with the cold air.\nAfter a few minutes, carefully lift the lid and remove the bun gently from the steamer.\nWhen cool enough to handle, remove parchment paper from bottom of buns.\nServe warm.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nUse bleached flour for a whiter bread.\nThe ideal sweetness of the baozi is subjective - in China, they generally get sweeter the further south you go. This recipe is fairly sweet, but can be modified either way.\nDepending on taste, you can add salt to the dough -  1/2 tsp. should be sufficient. Remember not to allow concentrated salt to come into contact with the yeast, as it will kill it. Mix the salt with the flour, then add the yeast.\nEnsure the place used for rising is draft-free. Drafts prevent the dough from rising as much, resulting in a flatter bread.\nUse flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands, not oil. This keeps the dough from getting too wet. It is cooked in a damp environment, so you don't want wet dough.\nTry to keep the dough from drying out and forming a crust when not being worked with. Rise in a covered container (using clingfilm), and cover with a towel when not immediately handling the dough.\nAdd a couple of tablespoons of vinegar to the steaming water to bleach the buns slightly. The vinegar does not significantly affect the taste of the buns.\nTry to use a bamboo steamer. Although a metal one will suffice, it doesn't impart a subtle flavour to the buns like bamboo, and it won't prevent water from forming on flat surfaces and making soggy patches.\nCommon baozi fillings\nChar Siu - Chinese honey roast pork (cha shao, char siu or sometimes \"Chinese BBQ\")\nRed Bean Paste - A sweet paste made of azuki beans and sugar\nJiu Cai (simplified: Jiu Cai , Pinyin: jiu3 cai4) - Chinese chives\nLuobosi (simplified: Luo Bu Si , Pinyin: luo2bo si1) - Thinly sliced radish\nXiaolong Bao (Xiao Long Bao ) - \"Little dragon\" dumplings, one of the most famous fillings, usually soupy with spicy pork. Highly variable depending on region.\nWarnings\nKeep leftovers refrigerated.\nTo reheat, steam for 10-15 minutes or heat in microwave for 30-45 seconds. Reheating by steaming gives better results.\nConversion notes\n| Weight conversions from USDA National Nutrient Database. Original recipe text and ingredient order preserved. Water density adjustment for 38degC applied.\n\n| This excessive amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.775% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1.05% active dry yeast, although in all cases you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions will result in less yeast flavor and longer bulk fermentation times."

Add chicken and marinate for 6-24 hours; longer is better.\nPeel almonds by boiling in a small amount of water for 1-2 minutes, cooling, and squeezing the nuts from the skins.\nChop onion/leek finely and fry lightly in a large frying pan with a bit of oil.\nAdd vegetables, roughly in the order you find logical (i.e., tomatoes don't take long, zucchini can be in the pan from the start of cooking).\nAdd salt. This will extract water from the vegetables and make them stew faster. You can cover the pan if it goes slowly--this slows the evaporation and allows the vegetables to cook in the water they lose.\nDump the cooked vegetables into a bowl or a small pot to keep them warm, and use the remaining oil to fry the cherry tomatoes, if you have those; once done, keep them separate from the other vegetables.\nFry almonds gently in the pan.\nAdd chicken meat, and fry on high temperature quickly; when it looks done, cut the largest piece open to see if it is done inside as well. The pieces should be lightly browned. Don't worry, this is the sugar in the honey turning to caramel.\nServe meat and vegetables with rice.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nFor special occasions, cherry tomatoes will make the meal very interesting (due to the contrast between the sweet chicken, bitter celery and sour tomatoes).\nAdding cubes of salted and fried mango to the meat just before it's done tastes great. Kiwifruit works too, but not as well. Any sour-ish hard fruit should do the trick. Banana is good too, but it doesn't offer the same contrast."

It originates from Brittany (Bretagne), a region in the west of France, where it is traditionally served with cider.\n\nIngredients\nBatter\n220 g (1 cup / 8 oz) plain flour\n345 ml (1  1/2 cup / 12 fl oz) milk\n2 eggs\n2 tbsp oil or melted butter\n1 pinch of salt\nOptional fillings\nSugar and lemon\nRaspberry jam and chocolate sauce\nNutella and sliced banana\nNutella and chopped hazelnuts\nWhipped cream\nChocolate, caramel, or butterscotch sauce\nFrangipane\nPeanut butter\nSugar and butter, possibly with lemon or cinnamon\nStrawberries (fresh or frozen)\nCream cheese and brown sugar\nSlivers of chicken, broccoli, and cheese sauce\nProcedure\nPut the flour at the bottom of a mixing bowl and make a hole in the middle where you put the eggs, the melted butter, the salt and a bit of milk.\nMix well by hand, slowly combining the liquid with the flour to get a thick paste.\nContinue mixing and slowly add the rest of the milk, mixing well to avoid making lumps.\nAllow to stand, perhaps for several hours, whilst the gluten rests--this is very important for the final texture.\nHeat a crepe pan (non-stick recommended) or skillet. A drop of water can be used to test the pan temperature: too cold, and the water will sit on the pan, too hot and it will vanish immediately. At the right temperature, the water will seem to \"dance\" on the pan.\nGrease the pan with some butter. Pour in some batter while tilting the pan to make the crepe as thin as possible.\nCook for 30-60 seconds until the cooked side looks like the surface of the moon, then flip it over to cook the other side; with some practice, you can flip it in the air by swinging the pan. See the whole-wheat pancakes recipe for air-flipping instructions.\nServe with maple syrup, caster sugar, jam, spreads, etc. The crepes can be filled and folded into triangles or rolled up.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThe exact proportions are not critical. In practice, equal parts by volume of eggs, milk, and flour, measured by eye, with no other ingredients, still produces excellent results.\nYou may add a bit of liqueur (traditionally brandy or fleur d'oranger) to the batter for more flavor.\nFor a sweet crepe, add 2 teaspoons sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla\nFor a chocolate crepe, add 2 tablespoons chocolate sauce.\nFor a cheesy crepe, sprinkle Emmental cheese evenly over the crepe while in the pan.\nOne can also substitute beer or soda water for the milk. The wheat flour can be replaced by buckwheat flour to make savory buckwheat crepes, as a main dish (ham, cheese, etc.).\nThe batter ingredients above can be replaced by 5 eggs, 1 cup flour, and 1 cup milk for a simpler mixture.\nSee also\nCookbook:Nutella Crepes"

The procedure is due to Dawn Yanagihara.[1] For additional information on the dish, see the creme brulee disambiguation page.\n\nIngredients\nIngredient\n\nCount\n\nVolume\n\nWeight\n\n\nHeavy cream, cold\n\n\n\n1.4 L (2  1/2 pints / 6 cups)\n\n1.4 kg\n\n\nGranulated sugar\n\n\n\n240 ml (1 cup)\n\n9 oz\n\n\nVanilla pods\n\n2 ea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgg yolks\n\n18 ea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemerara, turbinado, or granulated sugar\n\n\n\n60 ml (12 tsp)\nProcedure\nWith the oven rack adjusted to its lower middle position, preheat the oven to 300degF (150degC). Fold a kitchen towel to cover the bottom of a large roasting pan and arrange 12 ea. 5-ounce (150 ml) ramekins on the towel. The ramekins should not touch each other or the side of the roasting pan. If the roasting pan is not large enough, scale down the recipe.\nCombine 3 cups of the cream and sugar in a medium saucepan. With a paring knife, halve the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the saucepan. Submerge the pods in the cream. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Remove the saucepan from the heat and steep the mixture for 20 minutes to infuse the flavor.\nMeanwhile, separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a large bowl and storing the whites for another use. Bring a kettle of water to a boil.  After the cream has steeped remove the pods and stir in the remaining 3 cups of cream to cool the mixture.\nWhisk the egg yolks until they are evenly combined. Add a cup of the cream mixture to the yolks and whisk until combined. Continue adding cups of cream and whisking until evenly colored. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a second bowl. Ladle the mixture into the 12 ramekins.\nPlace the roasting pan onto the oven rack and pour in boiling water until it reaches  2/3  the height of the ramekins. Do not splash water into the ramekins. Bake until an instant-read thermometer registers 170-175degF (77-79degC) or until the edges of the custard are set, with a spot in the center about the size of a quarter remaining wiggly. The baking time depends upon the height of the ramekins. If shallow, start checking at 30 minutes. Higher ramekins can take up to an hour to bake.\nRemove ramekins from roasting pan and cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Place on a shallow tray, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Before serving, uncover the ramekins and soak up any condensation with paper toweling. Spread 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar on each, tilting and tapping to spread the sugar evenly. Spread sugar only on the number of ramekins that will be served. The others can be stored for several days in the refrigerator for later use.\nIgnite a propane blowtorch and caramelize the sugar on each ramekin. Take care to direct the flame away from any ignitable material. Avoid the miniature butane torch since its flame is not adequate for uniform caramelization in a reasonable amount of time, and the finished dish may taste of butane. Re-chill the ramekins for not more than 45 minutes.  A longer time leads to softening of the caramelized crust.\nServe and enjoy!\nNotes, tips, and variations\nWithout a torch the sugar may also be caramelized in these ways:\nAfter spreading the sugar over the ramekins, place them as close as you can under a very hot broiler. Watch them closely because this method tends to be uneven and burn. Too long under the broiler can also result in the custard turning into a sort of chunky soup which is not a very appealing texture. Works best with fine granulated sugar.\nHeat the sugar in a saucepan over medium heat without stirring until it starts to melt, then stir with a wooden spoon until caramelization occurs (this is easier to tell with white sugar than Turbinado) and spoon over the ramekins, tilting and rotating them to cover with an even layer.\nAlternately, combine the sugar with half as much water by volume, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook without stirring 3 to 5 minutes, tilting the pan as required to ensure even caramelization. If the caramel hardens due to cooling, warm over low heat until it is again pourable.\nRegular granulated sugar may also be used for the caramelization process in place of the brown sugar.\nA towel may also be placed into the roasting pan prior to adding the water to help distribute the heat across the bottom of the ramekins evenly as well as insulate the bottoms from the heat coming through the bottom of the pan.\nMake sure that before adding the cream to the egg yolks, the cream has cooled down. If one adds hot cream, the yolks will start to clot, ruining the final product.\nIt is possible to substitute half-and-half or milk for the cream, provided that a few more egg yolks are added for texture.\nReferences\n\nSee also\n"

Cut a layer of baking paper and foil for the top, leaving a crease in the middle so the pudding can expand, place it on top of the basin, and secure it with string.\nCook the pudding by either:\nSteaming for 8 hours: put the pudding into a steamer with simmering water. Cover with a lid and top up the water level as needed for 8 hours.\nBoiling for 7 hours: To boil, place a metal jam lid, or any kind of circular, thin metal object, at the bottom of a large pan to be a trivet. Create 2 strips of large string or foil and place them on the trivet so you can easily pick up your pudding once its cooked. Make sure there is enough to hang over the side of your pot, so its easy to get a hold of. Then, slowly place your pudding onto the trivet and pour boiling water in so that it reaches halfway up the side of your pudding bowl. Cover with a lid and let the water simmer for 8 hours until the pudding has reached a dark deep brown, adding more water as needed.\nRemove your pudding and leave to cool for 1-2 hours. Once cool, remove the paper and foil and replace it with fresh paper and foil. Store in a cool, dry area. The pudding can be frozen for up to 1 year.\nTo serve, steam or boil your pudding for two hours to reheat. Once reheated, turn it out onto a serving plate.\nTo flame, warm a small amount of brandy in a pan, pour it over the hot pudding once at the table and light it with a matchstick or other easily used flame. Place your bowl of brandy butter on the table for people to enjoy with your pudding.\nExternal links\nWatch English Heritage's \"The Victorian Way - Christmas Pudding\" video using Eliza Acton's recipe from their book Modern Cookery (1845).\nReferences\nThis page incorporates text from the public domain cookbook Modern Cookery for Private Families by Eliza Acton."

        "url": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Christmas_Ham",
        "text": "Cookbook:Christmas Ham\ndesc\nThe ancient Romans, who sacrificed a pig to their god Saturn about the same time Christmas is celebrated nowadays, are probably the starters of a Christmas tradition still alive in some parts of the world. This is a recipe for a boneless, lightly salted Finnish-style ham, popular since about the 1940s, before which Finns used to eat several kinds of meats during Christmas.\n\nIngredients\n1 ea. (7-10 kg) ham, lightly salted and boneless\nPrepared mustard\nBreadcrumbs\nProcedure\nIf ham is frozen, thaw it in its plastic package, for 3 days in the refrigerator for a 7kg ham, 5 days for a 10kg ham.\nBefore putting the ham in the oven, take it out from the refrigerator and let come closer to room temperature. If you intend to put the ham in the oven in the evening, take it out during the early morning. The ham should be about 10 degC (50 degF)  when you put it in the oven.\nUse a wet paper towel to clean the ham a bit; then dry it.\nPlace ham on baking tray in oven, with some water on the tray. Or, if you have a large roasting bag, there is no need for water. Do not use only the oven rack, as nothing will catch all the liquid from the ham if the roasting bag fails, messing up your oven. However, you can put the ham on the rack if you put a baking tray beneath that to catch drips.  Aluminum foil can be used on the baking tray to protect it.\nPreheat oven to 200 degC (390 degF) and let ham roast in the oven for half an hour. You can skip this if you are not worried about the possible bacteria on the ham.\nTurn temperature down, and cook at 100-125 degC (210-260 degF), for about 1 hour/kg (a 7 kg ham will take 7 hours or more) until a meat thermometer in the center of the ham reads 75-80 degC (158-176 degF). Traditional ham is ready at 80 degC but most take the ham out of the oven at 77 degC or so, when the ham has more water left in it and is considered tastier.\nAfter you take the ham out of the oven, wait a little while before removing the thermometer. It is recommended you do not pour the liquid from the bag or baking tray down the drain.\nWait until ham is cool enough to handle, then glaze it all over with mustard and breadcrumbs. First remove the rind from the ham, then cover the ham with mustard, then with breadcrumbs. Bake in a 250 degC (480 degF) oven for 10 minutes.\nThe ham is ready to eat when it has cooled down a bit. This makes about enough for 3 or 4 people for a week, but if you think you will not eat it all within a week, freeze the rest.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nA 10 kg ham is considered better-tasting as the pig has gotten bigger.\nThe use of a meat thermometer is recommended because the actual temperature of an oven commonly varies from its setting; thus the ham can be severely under- or overcooked if you do not use a thermometer. The thermometer should be placed in the middle of the ham. Be careful that it does not touch the oven walls. You can test if the thermometer works properly before using it by dipping it in boiling water-it should show about 100 degC (212 degF).\nIt is possible to salt a ham yourself if you buy ham from a farm or butcher or buy a pig in time to fatten it for Christmas. There are several methods available; here is one that is called tonkkosuolaus: Dissolve 1.8 kg large crystal salt into 10 L water, and cool to 0 degC or slightly lower. Fully submerge a 10 kg ham in the brine, and let it brine at around 0 degC for 2 months, replacing the brine from time to time. During the last week you can keep ham in water only if you want it to be slightly less salty.\nSeveral people swear by sauna-cooked ham, in which case you will put the ham in a sauna instead of an oven (glazing still done in oven). It will take maybe 12-24 hours for a ham in a 100 degC sauna, and several days in a 80 degC sauna. Use a meat thermometer if you use a sauna to cook a ham and remember to have something beneath the ham collecting all the liquid. Often people also use a wood-burning stove to cook a ham, this method is hardest as you can not use a meat thermometer easily with one, so unless you have good instructions to the very oven you have (or have a spare ham just in case), this would not be recommended for first-time Christmas ham lovers."

Put both in the refrigerator.\nCombine the egg yolks and hot water in a mixing bowl; maximum tap water temperature is enough, approx. 50-60degC (120-140degF). Using a mixer, beat slowly while adding the sugar, then speed up the mixer until the mixture is thick and becomes a light yellow color.\nStir the melted chocolate into the yolk mixture (the chocolate should have cooled enough that it does not hurt if you insert your finger). Mix immediately, otherwise this will cook the egg yolks, and you'll have chocolate scrambled eggs!\nWith a whisk (from now on do not use the mixer) add the egg whites in three parts to the chocolate mixture, followed by the whipped cream.\nThe finished mousse should be light brown and very fluffy. While it is still liquid, divide it into individual serving dishes. Allow to chill in the refrigerator for 4-6 hours before serving. The mousse will be quite firm when ready.\nNotes, tips and variations\nThis recipe is not the \"purest\" form, which contains only bittersweet chocolate and eggs: 6 eggs for 200 g (8 oz) of chocolate; no cream, no sugar.\nIt is one of the easiest recipes for untrained cooks. The only \"difficult\" parts are separating the eggs and folding the egg whites.\nFor the more advanced cook: use a fourth yolk (and only the yolk!); it ensures that the mousse becomes firm. However, the mixture must be worked faster, beginning with the addition of the chocolate to the yolk/sugar mixture.\nInstead of the water, use an alcoholic spirit such as Cognac, Cointreau, Kahlua, Triple Sec, etc., for all or part of the 30 ml. However, the mousse is then not suitable for children or pregnant women.\nCoffee can also be satisfyingly substituted for the liquid.\nAlmond powder, almond butter, or orange rind can also be used to add flavor to the mousse (one tablespoon per 6 eggs)\nThere is also an Atkins-friendly recipe.\nWarnings\nThis mousse is best consumed within 24 hours.\nDo not keep substantially longer, even if refrigerated."

Feel free to omit from or add to the ingredient list as your pantry allows.\n\nIngredients\n1/2 tbsp vegetable oil\n1 large sweet onion, coarsely chopped\n1 small red onion, coarsely chopped\n3-10 garlic cloves, minced\n3-4 leftover hamburger patties, grilled and chilled\n4 tsp ground cumin\n2 tsp chili powder\n 1/2 tsp salt\n4-5 small sweet chiles\n1 small can of chipotle chiles in adobo sauce\n12 oz (330 ml) hoppy beer (recipe developed with Lagunitas IPA)\n1 large can (14.5 oz / 411 g) of chopped tomatoes, or more\n1 small can of tomato paste\n1 can (14.5 oz / 411 g) black beans, drained and rinsed\n1 can (14.5 oz / 411 g) dark kidney beans, drained and rinsed\ntableside additions such as sour cream, shredded cheese, Fritos, Cheese-its, etc.\nProcedure\nMeat\nUsing a food processor, grind the leftover hamburger patties into a coarse powder.\nIn a bowl, mix the ground hamburgers with the cumin, chili powder, and salt. Set aside. Don't bother cleaning the food processor after grinding the meat.\nChile paste\nAdd the sweet chiles to the food processor one-by-one, and grind until they're reduced to small bits.\nAdd the chipotles along with the adobo sauce, grinding until the chipotles are thoroughly integrated into the sauce. You can leave this in the food processor or move it to a bowl.\nCooking\nHeat a stockpot over medium heat and add the oil.\nSwirl the oil in the pan to coat, and turn the heat down to medium-low.\nSaute the onions and garlic until soft and golden.\nBy now the onions should be pretty well cooked down. Turn the heat up to medium and stir continuously.\nThe onions may start to brown and stick to the bottom of the stockpot. Add half the beer to deglaze the pan.\nAdd the ground meat and spices, tomato products, beans, chile paste, and remainder of the beer, stirring after each addition to combine.\nWhen the pot comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low and cover.\nSimmer for at least half an hour.\nServe in bowls, either plain or with accompaniments suggested above."

        "text": "Cookbook:Chinese Rice Porridge (Congee)\ndesc\nCongee is a type of rice porridge eaten across Asia. It may also be called juk, zhou, ganji, or other similar variations.\n\nIngredients\nBase\n220 g (7.75 oz) round rice, washed and drained\n2.5 L (10  1/2 cups) water or chicken broth\nLight soy sauce, to personal preference\nSesame oil, to personal preference\nWhite pepper, to personal preference\nGarnish\n3 spring onions, chopped\n4 tbsp freshly-chopped coriander leaves\n2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds\n30 g (1 oz) sliced ginger\nProcedure\nPut the rice in a pan and add the bouillon or water. Bring to a boil.\nTurn down the heat and leave over low heat for 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours, or until all the rice has turned into a mash.\nAdd soy sauce and sesame oil and flavor with white pepper.\nFinally, add the toppings according to personal preference.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nDo not overwash the rice, as doing so will wash out the starch, and the congee will not congeal properly. Congee can be made with most types of rice, to help other types of rice to break up, after washing drain and mix in a tea spoon of vegetable oil, then add the rice to the water after having brought the pot to the boil. If you are in a rush, initially start with about a third of the liquid you need, adding the remainder as you cook.\nOnce the rice had turned into a mush and has released all its starch, a soup can be made by skimming off the top layer of liquid. You will only get one good bowl of this soup per pot of congee, and it is valued as a food for convalescents and babies.\nInstead of bouillon, a chicken carcass or pork bones can be added to the cooking water, the congee creates its own stock as it cooks. If using bones, blanch and wash under cold water before use.\nVery hot plain congee can be used to cook raw meat and fish (either thinly sliced or diced), which is then eaten with the congee. Among the traditional Chinese favourites are sliced grass carp, sliced lean pork, sliced pork liver, diced beef and diced chicken breast.\nThe two traditional companions to breakfast congee are plain soya sauce chow mein and youtiao."

        "text": "Cookbook:Chilaquiles\ndesc\nThe following recipe is quite common in most of Mexico as a breakfast item, due to the addition of eggs, but is also eaten throughout the day including during dinner time. The additional recipe for a salsa de chile de arbol will be used as the primary sauce.\n\nIngredients\nSalsa de chile de arbol\n1 cup tomatillos, dehusked\n4-6 dried chiles de arbol, roasted\n1 clove garlic\n 1/2 cup water\nSalt to taste\nPepper to taste\nChilaquiles\nVegetable oil (enough to cover the tortillas to deep-fry them)\n2 day-old corn tortillas, cut into strips then squares\n1 standard egg\n 1/4 white onion, diced\nCrumbled or shredded cheese\nProcedure\nSalsa de chile de arbol\nRoast the tomatillos by wrapping them in heavy duty aluminum foil and placing them on a comal (cast iron skillet) over your stovetop (this does not need to be done in the oven; it never is in Mexico).\nAfter roasting the tomatillos for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, pull them off the heat and reserve.\nRoast the dried chilies and garlic directly on the comal. Caution: the dried chilies will roast in less than a minute while the garlic will take longer.\nCombine the roasted tomatillos, chilies, garlic, water, salt, and pepper in a blender. Liquefy the mixture thoroughly for a few minutes to ensure that the sauce is smooth and consistent with no large pieces left floating around. You will probably end up with more salsa than you need for this recipe. Use it as a condiment for any other of your favorite Mexican dishes!\nChilaquiles\nHeat enough vegetable oil in a frying pan to deep fry the tortillas. It should be hot enough so that when you drop the pieces of tortillas into it they immediately begin to fry at a rapid pace.\nAllow the tortillas to fry until they become a chestnut brown, just not too dark or burnt. At this point, drain most of the oil out of the pan leaving only enough to fry the rest of the ingredients.\nCrack the egg into the fried tortillas and scramble it, folding the fried tortilla strips into the egg. At this point season this mixture with salt and pepper if desired. Take this mixture out of the pan and let it rest on a plate while you continue with the rest of the dish.\nAdd some of the oil that was taken out of the pan earlier back into it and heat it up again. To this add the diced onion, and allow it to soften for a few minutes. Add the salsa de chile de arbol to the oil and onions and saute it for a minute or two. Add a little bit of water to dilute it if it becomes too thick.\nFinally, return the fried tortilla and egg mixture to the onion and chili sauce in the pan and allow it cook only for about a minute, enough time to allow the tortillas to soak up some of the sauce.  Before plating it, add the cheese and enjoy!\nNotes, tips, and variations\nIn Mexico, very rarely is this dish made with tortilla chips but rather day-old tortillas that have stiffened. If you don't have day-old tortillas you can leave out fresh tortillas until they are stiff to get the right texture.\nThe chiles are very hot; adjust to taste.\nFor the cheese, you can use anything that melts well such as Monterey Jack or Manchego\nThe recipe for the chili sauce used in this recipe is of course a red sauce. If you prefer a green sauce, simply substitute the chiles de arbol with fresh jalapeno chilies that you can also roast in the same way. After you have roasted the chilies on the comal and thoroughly burnt the skins, place the chilies in a plastic bag with a small amount of water so as to allow them to steam. After about 5 minutes, remove the jalapenos from the bag and simply rub the skin off of them. Continue to make the sauce as indicated above.\nThis dish can be made with strips of chicken in addition to or as a replacement for the egg. In Mexico chilaquiles are often served throughout the day and as such the addition of chicken strips will complement it as a dinner item. Using all the same ingredients just add some warmed and shredded chicken meat during the last step before you add the cheese.  Oftentimes, my mother would add a little bit of Mexican cream (somewhat like sour cream but more akin to creme fraiche) over the top of the chilaquiles right before we enjoyed them on our serving plate as a way to tone down the spicy heat of the dish."

If using a pressure cooker, do not depressurize but let the cool down; depressurizing causes the chickpeas to break open.\nCook onions in the broth until softened.\nAdd zucchini, tomatoes, bell pepper, chili pepper, and garlic and cook for 10-15 minutes, until peppers and zucchini are soft.\nStart boiling the rice.\nAdd chickpeas, peanut butter, spices, and soy sauce. Keep simmering for 5-10 more minutes.\nSprinkle with cilantro garnish if desired, then serve immediately.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nIf a very thick sauce is desired, cook longer. The zucchini will disintegrate, thickening the sauce.\nIf you used dry chickpeas, use the cooking water and broth half and half, instead of pure broth.\nThe chili pepper can be replaced by chili powder or completely omitted if a less spicy dish is desired.\nTo get a stronger taste, use up to 2 tsp each of coriander, turmeric, cumin.\nAdd 2 tsp garam masala for a more authentic taste."

Don't be fooled by the name; there's no gluten in glutinous rice flour (or any rice flour, for that matter). This flour, like most gluten-free flours, is easy to find if an Asian grocery can be located. It can also be found in many boutique grocery stores, such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Other gluten-free flours may be substituted, but be prepared to adjust the amount of flour needed to compensate for variations in starchiness.\n\nIngredients\n1/2 cup (1 stick / 120 ml) butter\n 1/2 cup (120 ml) white granulated sugar\n 1/2 cup (120 ml) brown sugar\n2 ea.

Don't worry about over-mixing; since there is no gluten in the flour, there is no danger of overworking it.\nFold in the chocolate chips.\nLine cookie sheet with silicone mat and spoon on balls of dough, about 1 1/2 inches (4 cm) in diameter.\nPut cookie dough in the fridge for 30-40 minutes or into the freezer for 10-20 minutes.\nBake until golden brown.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThese will likely take longer to bake than gluten-containing cookies--perhaps about 25 minutes. Baking time will depend on the flour you use, since the protein content of the flour will determine the rate of browning from the Maillard reaction.\nThe silicone baking sheet liner is important, as these cookies tend to stick to the pan more than most. If you don't have one, parchment paper might also work."

The ideal is to have the sauce with little separate liquid when it is served - but not dry enough to scorch. It may be simmered on top of the stove, or in a very low oven, or in a slow cooker. The sauce is edible after about 40 minutes but is infinitely better flavoured and textured after 3 or 4 hours.\nAbout 30-40 minutes before serving remove the bay leaves, add the oregano and the beans and stir well.\nAdjust the salt as needed, stir well, and cook for another 40 minutes.\nServe with long-grain rice, or however else you like to serve chili.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nTry adding small quantities of cinammon, ground cloves and/or mace--experiment for yourself.\nIn a slow cooker it can be cooked for 8 hours. The flavour is even better if it is cooked, allowed to cool overnight, and reheated for 30 or 40 minutes, but this is a council of perfection and not really necessary.\nDried kidney beans are so indigestible as to be considered poisonous unless they are boiled briskly (a slow cooker will not do) for at least twenty minutes to destroy the indigestible phytohaemagglutinin that they contain. If you do use dried kidney beans they must be soaked overnight and then boiled by themselves for at least 20 minutes. They are then added to the chili early enough to cook for at least 2 hours. All this is tedious--it is therefore much better to use tinned ones as suggested in this recipe."

It should not be confused with Chicken Tikka Masala (of which it is an ingredient). It is traditionally cooked on skewers in a tandoor and is usually boneless. It is tasty when served with yellow rice and a spicy salad.\n\nIngredients\n675 g (1.5 lb) skinless and boneless chicken breast, diced into cubes\n1 tbsp mustard seed oil (see notes)\n50 ml (2 fl oz) milk\n150 ml (5 fl oz) natural yoghurt\n2 tbsp lemon juice\n1 tbsp tomato paste\n2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro (coriander leaves)\n4 large cloves of garlic, finely chopped\n1-4 chopped fresh red chillis (depending on strength of the chillis and the desired strength of the marinade)\n2 tsp paprika\n2 tsp garam masala\n1 tsp cumin powder\n 1/2 tsp turmeric\n1 tsp salt (use rock salt for best results)\nProcedure\nAdd all of the ingredients except the chicken to a non-metallic mixing bowl, and mix well.\nAdd the chicken and mix until fully coated.\nIdeally, the chicken should now be left in a refrigerator to marinate for at least 24 hours. It may not be safe to leave chicken which has previously been frozen for longer than 24 hours, but fresh chicken should be left to marinate for 48 hours for best results. If you do not wish to leave the chicken to marinate, simply continue to the next step.\nFor best results, place on skewers and cook in a tandoor or ceramic pot oven. The chicken can also be cooked on skewers under a medium grill for 5-8 minutes on each side or barbecued (cooking times depend on the temperature of the barbecue). Always ensure the chicken is cooked throughout before serving. It should come apart easily when pressed down with the side of a fork.\nServe with naan, with rice or use in a Chicken Tikka Masala.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nMustard seed oil is considered unfit for human consumption in many parts of the world and is therefore not readily available. A poor alternative can be made by crackling 1 tsp of mustard seeds in approximately 2 tbs of very hot vegetable or olive oil. Allow to cool then use in place of mustard seed oil.\nIt is possible to make a tikka with almost any meat, the most commonly used other than chicken being lamb and mutton.\nTikka can be served either as main meal or as an appetiser.\nPowdered or dried ingredients can be substituted for fresh, but at the expense of taste.\nSome people prefer to make tikka with meat on-the-bone for improved flavour.\nBibliography\nCurry Club Tandoori and Tikka Dishes, Piatkus, London -- ISBN 0749912839 (1993)\nIndia: Food & Cooking, New Holland, London -- ISBN 978-1845376192 (2007)"

Brown rapidly, then season with paprika to taste.\nTurn heat down, add enough water added to cover the bottom of the pan, and cook on low. Keep covered but with the lid slightly cocked to prevent boiling.\nProceed with the dumplings while cooking the chicken.\nDumplings\nCombine flour, eggs, and a pinch of salt with enough to make a dough. For dumplings to be 'sticky' inside, make a wetter dough; for all the way through, make a drier dough.\nUse a dessert spoon (or a melon baller for smaller dumplings) to drop pieces of dough into boiling salted water. To keep them from sticking to the spoon, let it heat up in the water.\nLet simmer until the dumplings float. Drain, put in a bowl with a tiny slick of melted fat, and keep them to one side in a warm place.\nAssembly\nOnce the chicken is fully cooked (160degF) and your dumplings are all done, stir dumplings and sour cream into the pan of chicken. Mix thoroughly but carefully to coat.\nAdd more paprika until it is more pink (or orange) than white.\nTaste sauce; it may need more paprika or salt. Sometimes it is easier to remove the chicken, and then pour the dumplings and sour cream over the top to coat (when serving), depending on how big your pan is.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nUse seeded rye bread to sop up the sauce when you're done eating."

Sometimes (usually in America) it is called Chinese BBQ pork. It is very popular, and can be eaten by itself (usually cold), or used as an ingredient for other dishes such as cha shao bao (pork buns), or in noodles or rice.\n\nIngredients\n1 kg (2.25 lbs) pork shoulder\n2 tbsp dark soy sauce\n2 tbsp light soy sauce\n2 tbsp oyster sauce\n2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine\n2 tbsp clear honey\n4 tbsp hoisin sauce\n 1/2 tsp five spice\nProcedure\nSlice the meat into strips about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide by 6 inches (15 cm) long. A long thin strip like this will keep its shape better when hanging.\nPierce the pork all over thoroughly with a fork. This makes the pork more tender and allows the marinade to penetrate the meat to give flavour all the way through.\nMix all other ingredients together to make a marinade.\nPlace pork strips in a tray and cover with marinade. Ensure strips are covered completely in marinade.\nCover tightly with cling film and place in the refrigerator for several hours (8-24 hours is preferable).\nPreheat the oven to 230degC or 420degF and place a pan in the bottom to catch drippings. Line this pan with aluminium foil to make cleaning easier.\nHang the meat on hooks in the oven or lay them on a rack. Depending on the method and the size of your oven, it may be easiest to do this in two or three batches, rather than all at once.\nRoast for 20 minutes, until pork is cooked all the way through. Baste at least twice to build up a good layer of marinade on the outside of the meat. The pork should turn a golden-red colour as it cooks.\nAllow to cool while still hanging, or lay on wire rack to cool. Avoid laying on top of other meat or on a flat surface until cooled.\nCover and refrigerate until needed.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nServe cold, or use diced in other dishes.\nAdd 1 tbsp of toasted sesame oil for a nuttier flavour\nAdd red food colouring to the marinade to give the traditional deep red hue. This used to be due to the preservative used for the pork. Also, in China, the red colour generally symbolises good fortune. However, due to the strong colour of the marinade described above, a significant quantity of food colouring will be needed.\nThis dish goes very well with ginger and onion.\nWarnings\nUse care in handling the raw pork. Wash hands and utensils that come into contact with raw pork. Don't allow raw pork or its juices to come into contact with other foods, unless they are to be cooked afterwards."

Original recipe text preserved. Reordered ingredients to match procedure section.  Warm water was missing from ingredient list, so it was added in the appropriate sequential order.  Bread flour presumed, protein ratio of \"Bakers' flour\" not disclosed.  \"Bread improver\" is ambiguous, there is no USDA data for either \"bread improver\" or \"improver\".  Cheddar cheese presumed.  Caster sugar is superfine sugar, substituting granulated sugar. \"Bacon pieces\" not in USDA database, substituting data for \"Bacon bits, meatless\".\n\n| This amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.75% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1% active dry yeast, although in all cases you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions in yeast amount will further decrease yeast flavor, and result in increases in bulk fermentation time.\n\n| An average figure would typically be in the range of 55-62% based on flour weight, and is somewhat dependent on the protein level of the flour.  Presuming bread flour, 60-62% should work okay.  If the flour is of lower protein, such as all purpose, then use a slightly lower value.\n\n| There are many different kinds of improver used in bread, sometimes they're just minerals, others have synthetic chemicals, so practice care with selection, and make sure to follow manufacturer's directions.

        "text": "Cookbook:Double Hamburgers\ndesc\nA double hamburger is a variant on a sandwich involving a patty of ground meat, usually beef (known in the United Kingdom as a beefburger), or a vegetarian patty. A slice of cheese on the patty makes it a cheeseburger, a common variation in the United States.\n\nIngredients\n500 g (1.1 lb) minced (ground) beef\nHerbs and spices (optional; see suggestions)\nCheese (optional; see suggestions)\nSalad (lettuce, spinach, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, onion etc; optional)\n1 hamburger bun per burger\nProcedure\nRemove the ground beef from the package and shape by hand into burgers. You should get 4-6 burgers from the listed quantity of beef.\nIf adding optional ingredients, either season the outside or mix into the beef before forming the patties. Overworking the beef will result in mushy meat that won't stick together, so only mix the minimum necessary and do so by hand.\nFry or grill the burgers for about 4-5 minutes on each side for burgers that aren't too thick.\nLet the burger rest for several minutes before serving to let the juices cool down and not burst out at first bite.\nEnsure your burgers are fully cooked through before serving. If your burgers are quite thick or if you are unsure, you can cut one open to ensure the insides are browned. If the insides are red, there is a chance that the meat is not fully cooked. Alternately, you can insert a meat thermometer into the center of the burger, if the temperature reads less than 71degC (160degF), your burger is undercooked.\nServe each burger on a bun (sesame seed usually), optionally with relish, sliced pickles, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, ranch dressing, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and/or onions.\nNotes, tips and variations\nSome suggestions for seasonings include garlic, onion flakes or a small onion, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, mustard, olive oil, cheese, butter and/or 2 tsp of your favorite hot sauce for some kick. The amounts of herbs and/or spices are up to your local taste and meat quality. Depending on the quality of your local beef, for example, you may wish to add some beef stock to improve the flavour. If you add any liquids, mix the ground beef well, then squeeze out the extra juice when forming patties.\nMake sure to let the meat get to room temperature before putting on the grill or in the pan. This will help the burgers cook evenly and fully.\nYou can use almost any type of minced (ground) meat to make hamburgers, including pork, chicken, turkey, lamb, bison, venison, ostrich, or even a meat substitute such as Quorn.  Some variations of hamburgers call for mixing different types of meat (e.g. ground beef and ground pork).\nDo not add salt until right before you put the patty to cook.\nMixing ingredients in with the meat is purely optional. You can make a delicious burger by simply shaping patties and seasoning with kosher salt, ground pepper, and if you wish, some garlic powder and/or cayenne.\nDo not overmix the meat! You will wind up with a tough, dense, and dry burger. If you must mix herbs or spices in, do so by hand and be sparing in your mixing. Remember that you can season the outside of the patties if you wish.\nIf your burgers fall apart, adding an egg yolk will help keep it together. Buying lean ground beef will also help, although if the meat is too lean the burger may be excessively dry. Not mixing the ground meat in the first place will also ensure the patty's integrity.\nTry adding a pat of butter in the center of each burger for an excellent hamburger.\nYou may wish to experiment with including cheese in the centre of your burger before cooking.\nSpices which can work well in hamburgers include black pepper, chili (either fresh or powder), Worcestershire Sauce and soy sauce. Experiment to find good combinations.\nAlmost any herb can work, including basil, oregano and parsley.\nSome other things which are also sometimes added to hamburgers include: diced onions, bread crumbs, crushed saltine crackers.\nBurgers can also be smoked on a grill. Smoked burgers will appear red and glazed on the outside, but browned on the inside. Smoking a burger before grilling it is an excellent way to seal in the flavorful juices.\nSome vegan patties make excellent meat substitutes, especially for Hamburgers, where strong spices make the difference close to indistinguishable.\nHand-made burger patties always change shape during cooking, and always in the same way: the edges move in toward the middle. This means each burger will turn out less flat and more ball-shaped than the way you originally formed it. So for the best results, press the raw patties down much thinner than you want the finished burger to be."

Weight of instant yeast presumed the same as active dry yeast.  Presumed medium size onion.  Pinch defined as 1/16 teaspoon. \n\n| This amount of instant yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.775% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1.05% active dry yeast.  Fermentation times should be around 2 hours for these reduced yeast amounts provided fermentation temperatures are about 80 degF (27 degC). Cooler temperatures will result in somewhat longer fermentation times.  Further yeast reductions will result in less yeast flavor and longer bulk fermentation times.\n\n| This water was referred to in the procedure section, but was not listed as an ingredient.

        "text": "Cookbook:Deep Fried Chickpea Dough Curry Snacks (Pakoda)\ndesc\nPakoda is a savoury South Indian fried snack made from gram flour, spices and onions. This simple recipe is for Pakoda as made in Tamil Nadu, India. A different version called \"pakora\" is famous in the other parts of India. The difference is that for making pakora, the batter/mix can be a bit more liquidy like for making pancakes, and different vegetables like spinach or potatoes may be used.\n\nIngredients\n1 cup (240 g) besan or gram flour\n 1/2 cup water\n2 tsp rice flour (for crunch)\n2 tsp green gram flour (optional, for added crunch)\nSalt to taste\n 1/4 tsp asafoetida\n 1/4 tsp turmeric\n 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper\n8-10 curry leaves\n1 tsp cumin powder\n1 tsp crushed black peppercorns\n1 medium-sized onion, chopped finely\n 1/2 cup peanuts, preferably roasted\n1 tsp oil\nOil to fry\nProcedure\nCombine all the dry ingredients except the salt, peanuts, and onions. Mix well.\nAdd the onions, peanuts, 1 tsp oil, and salt. Mix well, then keep aside for about 10 minutes. The moisture from the onions will ooze out into the batter.\nAdding a little bit of water at a time, make a dough that will form chunks but break into pieces with a little bit of pressure. The consistency should be the same as when making scones. Too much water and the pakoda will not be crunchy.\nHeat oil in a heavy-bottomed cooking vessel.\nShape the dough into chunks, and deep-fry them in medium-hot oil until golden-brown and crispy. Too much turmeric might give it a darker color.\nServe hot or room temperature.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nStore at room temperature for about 3-4 days. Avoid refrigerating to maintain the crunchy texture.\n The pakoda may be served with ketchup or any style of chutney.\nA tradition during the monsoon season is to serve piping hot tea after pakodas."

Northerners claim it as their own because of the name. Southerners, in particular Sicilians, claim that it originated in the south and that \"Parmigiana\" is a misunderstanding for \"Palmigiana\", which is a type of shutter, alluding to the way in which the eggplant slices are laid. There are some variations (including a dessert version with chocolate) but mostly the ingredients are: eggplants, tomato sauce, basil leaves, mozzarella, and, obviously, Parmesan cheese.\n\nIngredients\n2 kg (4 lb) eggplants\n700 g (24 oz) fresh cooking tomatoes, or one large or two medium cans of plum tomatoes\n1 kg (2 lb) cows' milk mozzarella cheese, known in Italy as fiordilatte\n 1/2 large or 1 medium onion, sliced\nOlive oil\nFresh basil leaves\nParmesan or Grana Padano cheese\nProcedure\nCut eggplants lengthwise in  1/4 inch (0.75cm) thick slices, and put them in a plate covered by plenty of salt for about 1 hour. Wash off the excess salt and dry the slices with a paper towel.\nStart cooking the onion slices in olive oil; when the onion is soft add drained whole tomatoes and mash them with a fork. If the tomatoes are watery, add a small can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Add 2 leaves of basil and simmer for about 20 minutes.\nWhile the tomato sauce is cooking, fry the eggplant slices as follows. Fill a frying pan (cast iron if you have it) with  1/2 inch (1 cm) of olive oil and heat. When the oil is hot, start frying the eggplant slices a few at a time so that they do not overlap in the pan. Cook until golden, flipping once. Remove the eggplants and put them in a drainer so the excess oil can drain. Repeat until all the slices are cooked.\nTo assemble, start with a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a greased ovenproof baking pan or casserole. Then proceed with a layer of eggplants with their edges slightly overlapped and no voids. Add basil leaves and a layer of sliced mozzarella. Continue alternating layers until the eggplant is used up, and finish topping with tomato sauce and grated Parmesan or grana.\nBake in the oven for about 40 minutes at 350degF (180degC). Serve really hot. If you are lucky enough to have leftovers, they taste even better the day after."

It is very traditional and may be more likely served at family gatherings, especially in the U.S. \n\nIngredients\n15 oz (425 g / 445 ml) can English peas\n1-2 tbsp mayonnaise\n1-2 tbsp chopped white or yellow onion (optional)\n1 hard-boiled egg with yolk (or 2 hard-boiled egg whites, without yolks)\nSalt to taste\nGround black pepper to taste\nParsley for presentation (optional)\nProcedure\nIf desired, blanch or parboil the chopped onion in a small amount of water so that the onion flavor is not as strong. Drain and cool thoroughly.\nDrain the English peas, and either discard the liquid or use for some other purpose.\nLightly rinse the peas in a colander and place in a suitable bowl.\nChop the egg into about  1/4 inch (0.5 cm) pieces. If desired, mash the diced hard-boiled egg yolk and mix it thoroughly with the mayonnaise.\nAdd the chopped egg, chopped onion, and mayonnaise to the peas. Mix lightly until all the ingredients are well-distributed.\nAdd salt and ground pepper to taste, and mix to distribute.\nRefrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\nServe cold, sprinkled lightly with parsley in the manner of a side dish, rather than as a separate course. No additional dressings or condiments would ordinarily be served or expected.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nTry adding 2 Tbsp very finely-chopped ( 1/8  inch /  1/4 cm diced) celery\nAdding  1/4 cup (or less) cubed ( 3/8  inch or 0.75 cm diced) yellow cheese food product (for example Velveeta) gives a color contrast, but the cheese can become somewhat soft if the salad is stored. If you make the main part of the salad well in advance of serving, you may wish to wait to add cheese only when you are nearly ready to serve the sal ad.\nIf you use the entire egg, the yolk will impart a yellow tint to the salad dressing, while using the 2 hard-boiled egg white (i.e. no yolks) will keep the salad dressing white. Adding hard-boiled egg whites provides a shape and color contrast compared to the green color of the round peas.\nYou may wish to make the basic recipe a day or several hours in advance of serving, through the refrigeration step, then add other ingredients when nearly ready to serve."

They are likely originally from Galicia, Spain, where they were prepared rather like Cornish pasties as a portable and hearty meal for working people and often filled with leftovers or staple ingredients. Tuna and chicken are varieties still seen in Galicia.\n\nIngredients\nDough\n1 tsp salt\n2-3 cups cold water\n1 kg (about 8 cups) flour\n2 eggs\n200 g (about 1 cup) butter or margarine\nOlive oil\nCornstarch\nArgentinian filling (Relleno)\n1 kg ground beef\n1 large onion\n2 tbsp vegetable oil\n2 tbsp sugar\n1  1/2 tsp black pepper\n1  1/2 tsp paprika\n1 tsp salt\n 1/2 tsp ground cumin (comino), optional.

While kneading the dough, gradually add in more water until the dough is soft and stretchy. If the dough becomes sticky, add more flour.\nOnce the dough is the desired consistency, allow to rest for a couple minutes, then roll it out to a thickness of ~2-3 mm (1/10 inch).\nCut the dough into discs roughly 10-15 cm (4-6 inches) in diameter.\nArgentinian filling\nDice onion into small pieces and saute in vegetable oil in a large frying pan. Add ground beef, and brown it.\nWhile beef is browning, mix in salt, sugar and spices.\nOnce meat has finished cooking, remove from heat and add raisins.\nIf desired add sliced olives, egg, or potatoes.\nChilean filling\nDice onion into small pieces and saute in olive oil in a large frying pan. Mince garlic and add to the onions. Add and brown ground beef.\nWhile beef is browning, mix in salt, sugar, spices and bay leaf.\nAllow to simmer for about 20 minutes for flavours to blend.\nRemove bay leaf, and add olives and raisins.\nAssembly\nPlace 1-2 tablespoons of empanada filling into the center of one of the dough discs (tapa).\nIf Chilean empanadas are being made add one piece of the diced hardboiled egg next to the filling.\nWet the outer edge of the tapa with cold water and fold the tapa in half to encase the filling, ensuring there is no air left inside (the wet portion will help the dough stick together, air will burst out when cooked).\nHolding the empanada in the palm of one hand, with the round edge pointing outwards, pinch and twist over a small (finger-sized) portion of the dough at the top. Continue pinching and twisting around the outer edge until you reach the bottom of the empanada, so that the open edge is sealed shut.  You can also use a fork to smash together the lips of the outer edge, but it is not the traditional way and the filling can burst through.\nRepeat for the remaining filling and dough.\nTo cook the empanadas, deep fry in vegetable oil on medium heat until golden brown. Alternatively, you can brush them with butter and bake on a cookie sheet in the oven at 400 degF for 8-10 minutes or until light brown.\nAllow empanadas to cool and then eat.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nFor a flakier crust, before cutting it into discs, lightly coat the dough with olive oil and dust with cornstarch. Fold the dough in half (with the cornstarch on the inside) and again coat with oil and cornstarch. Fold again and roll out to a thickness of ~2-3 mm (1/10 inch)."

The buns are made with choux pastry, which is made by bringing butter and water to the boil, tipping in the flour and then beating in the eggs. \n\nIngredients\nChoux pastry\n75 g (2 1/2 oz /  2/3  stick) butter, diced\n200 ml (7 fl oz /  3/4 cup) water\nSalt\n100 g (4 oz /  3/4 cup) strong plain flour\n3 eggs, beaten\nCream filling\n250 ml (9 fl oz / 1 cup) double or whipping cream\nChocolate icing\n100 g (4 oz /  1/2 cup) caster sugar\n100 ml (3 1/2 oz /  3/8  cup) water\n50 g (2 oz) dark chocolate\n25 g (1 oz /  1/4 stick) unsalted butter\nProcedure\nChoux pastry\nHeat the oven to 200degC / 400degF / Gas 6.\nPlace the butter, water and a pinch of salt in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon as the butter melts. Meanwhile, sift the flour into a small bowl.\nWhen the butter has melted, turn up the heat and bring the mixture to the boil. Switch off the heat and quickly tip the flour into the saucepan. Immediately beat the flour into the liquid with the wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients together. Stop beating when the mixture swells into a smooth dough that comes away from the sides of the saucepan. This should take only a few seconds.\nLet the mixture cool for 3-4 minutes. Pour in a little of the beaten egg into the flour mixture and beat it in well. Keep adding and beating in the egg, a little at a time, until the dough looks thick, smooth and shiny and still holds its shape well. You may not need the last two or three tablespoonfuls of egg if your eggs are large.\nSpoon the mixture into a large freezer bag or a piping bag (you'll need to scrape it out of the pan with a flexible spatula). Fold down the top of the bag to squeeze the dough to the bottom. Snip off one of the bottom corners of the bag to give you a hole about 1 cm long.\nLine two flat baking sheets with baking parchment. Squeeze the mixture into chipolata-sized sausage shapes on to the parchment, allowing about 4 cm between each one (they will at least double in size in the oven). You should be able to make about 12.\nPlace the baking sheets in the preheated oven, and bake for about 30 minutes. Take the eclairs out when they are puffed up, golden brown all over, and feel hard when you poke one with a knife.\nImmediately take each eclair off the baking sheet--they will be very hot, so wear oven gloves--and, with the point of a knife, gently slit the side to let out the steam. Otherwise, the steam sits trapped in the eclair and turns back to water, leaving you with a soggy bun.\nLeave eclairs to cool and dry out on a wire rack.\nCream filling\nWhip the cream in a small bowl until it is just thick enough to hold its shape.\nPlace whipped cream in the fridge while you make the chocolate icing.\nChocolate icing\nFor the icing, place the sugar and water in a small saucepan over a low heat. Heat gently, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon to dissolve the sugar.\nBring to the boil, and boil fast for three minutes. Switch off the heat and wait for a few minutes for the syrup to cool down (you can speed this up by dipping the base of the pan in a bowl of cold water if you like).\nBreak up the chocolate and cut the butter into chunks.\nWhen the syrup is very warm, rather than very hot, add the chocolate and butter. Stir until both have melted and blended to a smooth, glossy sauce.\nLeave to cool, stirring occasionally. When the sauce starts to thicken, it's time to ice your eclairs.\nAssembly\nWhen the buns are cool, use a teaspoon or a piping bag to fill the inside of each eclair with whipped cream (you may need to enlarge the slit you made before).\nTake a different teaspoon and smear the chocolate icing generously over each eclair.\nLeave the eclairs on the wire rack until the icing has set. In the unlikely event that you're not going to eat them straight away, you can put them in the fridge for a few hours."

If your stove is electric, split the eggplant lengthwise, place face down on a cookie sheet, and bake in a hot oven on the top rack 30-45 minutes. For open flame roasting, use a fork to turn often. The skin should wrinkle and char, and flesh will shrivel and become soft. When eggplant is completely soft all over, remove to a bowl, slash once or twice to drain out bitter juice, and let rest until cool enough to handle. Some cooks suggest cooling the eggplant inside a brown paper bag.\nCut off stem and peel away skin. Scrape flesh into bowl of food processor or blender. Add garlic, tahini, lemon juice and process. Quantities depend upon size of eggplant and your preferences-please taste frequently. Salt to taste.\nServe at room temperature, drizzled with olive oil, and garnished with a black or green Mediterranean olive or sprigs of cilantro or parsley.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nIf you don't have a food processor or blender, the eggplant is quite easy to mash by hand. Mash the garlic with the flat of a broad knife, then mince it fine. Some cooks prefer mashing by hand to mechanical means as the blades of food processors can break the seeds, which releases undesirable bitter flavours. If you have a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic with salt into a paste. A large mortar and pestle can be used to mash all ingredients."

        "text": "Cookbook:French Toast\ndesc\nFrench toast is a common breakfast or dessert item made by frying a piece of bread soaked in an egg batter. French toast was developed as a way to use day-old stale bread. The literal translation of pain perdu is lost bread, referring to old or stale bread. When lacking stale bread, toasting your bread lightly will help it absorb more of the egg and milk batter.\n\nIngredients\nFrench toast\n1 egg\nAbout  1/4 cup (60 ml / 2 oz) milk or cream (more for softer, less eggy French toast; less for firmer, more eggy toast)\n2-3 slices bread (see notes)\nButter, margarine, or cooking oil\nOptional flavorings\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or similar\n 1/4-1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon or other powdered spices suitable for sweet foods\n 1/2 teaspoon sugar  or honey\n 1/4 teaspoon salt\n 1/4 teaspoon pepper\nSuggested toppings\nMaple syrup\nJam, jelly, fruit syrup\nWhipped cream\nPowdered sugar\nNuts\nHoney\nBacon\nRaspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and/or bananas\nProcedure\nIn a bowl, mix eggs and milk, and optional ingredients.\nHeat up a frying pan, skillet, or griddle to medium-low heat.\nGrease the pan with butter, margarine, or cooking spray.\nSoak a slice of bread in the egg-milk mixture and place on pan; repeat until pan is full or desired amount is placed.\nCook, turning once, until both sides of the bread are browned and the inside is cooked through.\nServe on plates, with toppings as desired.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThe goal is to get both sides of the French toast nicely browned, while making sure the center is cooked. Using excessive heat could scorch the outside of the toast while leaving the inside undercooked.\nIf making a small batch, soak the two slices until almost all of the mixture has been absorbed. If the bowl is small, place the two slices on top of each other, and keep switching and flipping them, so that all four sides will absorb the mixture.\nThe cooking process is too short to use most raw spices, but some fresh herbs might be very tasty.\nIf using sandwich bread, a plastic sandwich container may be used for the egg-milk mixture. This allows maximum use of the mixture, as the container is a good size and shape.\nToast your bread before dipping it into the mix to create a solid base.\nThe following types of bread are good used for French toast. Hard crust breads are recommended. Softer breads will create a soggy toast.\nSourdough\nChallah\nSchiacciata\nPortuguese sweet bread (\"Massa Suvada\"). This bread will take your french toast to new heights.\nWhole-wheat raisin bread or schiacciata.\nKing's Hawaiian Sweet Bread\nPanettone (bread with raisin, but may be too sweet for some)\nBrioche (weaved bread)\nChinese bakery loaves of bread.

Transfer to another plate if necessary.\nAdd salt and shake to ensure all French fries are evenly salted.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nYou can vary the size of the potato slices. Thick wedge shapes are home-style fries or English-style chips, while thinly julienned potatoes make for shoestring potatoes. Cooking times will need to be adjusted accordingly.\nTry adding other spices after cooking. Minced garlic is popular in California cuisine.\nInstead of ketchup, serve with mayonnaise, gravy, barbecue sauce, or salt, hummus, and vinegar.\nFor poutine (a French-Canadian treat), toss cooked fries with cheese curds and smother with gravy.\nSome cook the fries a single time in a generous amount of oil pre-heated to a temperature around 375 degF (190 degC) until they are golden and slightly crisp.\nThe method recommended by most cookbooks and used by many restaurants, is to cook them in two stages: first at around 350 degF (177 degC) until the fries are nearly cooked but limp and pale; after they have been removed from the oil and allowed to cool, they are briefly fried at a higher temperature of around 375 degF (190 degC) until golden and crisp.\nA method attributed to the celebrated French chef Joel Robuchon for the home cook says to put the sliced potatoes into a saucepan with just enough cold oil in it to cover the potatoes, then to cook them over high heat until golden, stirring occasionally.[1]\nWarnings\nDo not attempt to extinguish fat fires with water! If the oil becomes too hot, it may catch fire. Do not attempt to extinguish it with water, as this will cause an explosive reaction: oil floats on water, so water will only help the oil move up and get more oxygen. Instead, turn off the stove if possible, try to cover fire with a lid or any other piece of solid, non-flammable material, and use a class B fire extinguisher if the fire is still not under control. If that fails to work, evacuate and call the emergency service.\nRecipes featuring French fries\nPoutine\nFish and Chips\nChips, Cheese and Gravy\nReferences\n| \nSteingarten, Jeffrey.

Alternatively, if one likes more garlic, chop finely and throw in the caquelon.\nAdd the dry white wine and warm slightly on the stove top, over a low flame.\nMix the cornstarch with the cheese so that the cheese particles are well dusted, and add to the warm wine.\nMelt the cheese, stirring constantly in a figure eight pattern. Stir until the mixture has thickened and starts to boil up.\nAway from the heat, add the kirschwasser and blend in. Traditionally, the cornstarch is mixed into a slurry with the schnapps and added with it at this point. However, adding the cornstarch with the cheese makes it less likely that the fondue will separate and this method is used in many recipes for fondue.\nSeason with nutmeg and freshly ground pepper (black or white as you prefer).\nBring to the boil another 1 or 2 times.\nBring the caquelon to the table and place on the stand over a spirit burner. The heat should be regulated carefully so that the fondue stays hot but does not boil.\nBlitz method\nIf you are in a hurry, follow this method. As unconventional as it method is, it almost guarantees that your fondue will not separate because the stabilizing properties of the cornstarch are activated at the start.\nPour the wine into a cold caquelon with the garlic.\nMix the cornstarch to a slurry with the schnapps and add it to the wine.\nNow heat rapidly while whisking until the wine boils up and thickens.\nLower the heat and add the cheese a handful at a time until it melts, stirring constantly.\nServing\nEach diner has a dinner plate to hold bread cubes and accompaniments, and catch drips. Skewer cubes of bread with a fondue fork and dip into the cheese, turning the fork over to coat all sides. If you are especially hygiene conscious, agree between yourselves to slide the bread off onto your plates and eat it with a separate fork, resting the fondue fork in the caquelon while you are eating.\nTroubleshooting\nIf the right conditions for emulsification are not present, the aqueous and fatty components of a fondue may separate in much the same way as a mayonnaise may do so. This can be caused by the wrong  proportion of liquid to fat. In mayonnaise making, the problem occurs as a result of adding the oil too quickly. In a fondue the problem may occur in a number of ways:\nWhen using the traditional method (straight wine and cheese), melting occurs too rapidly.\nThe water boils off leaving too much fat in proportion to aqueous component.\nThe aqueous component is too great to hold an emulsion.\nThere is insufficient starch to stabilize the emulsion.\nA combination of the above.\nThe most effective solution is to:\nDissolve some more cornstarch in a half cup (50 ml) of wine.\nPut the fondue back on the stove top over medium heat.\nWhen it is boiling, lower the heat and slowly add the slurry while beating vigorously until thickening of the starch has occurred.\nIf it is too thick, add more wine, a little at a time until the right consistency is achieved, stirring constantly.\nIf necessary add some more grated cheese to taste.\nOnce you learn how it's done, this is always effective.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nIt is necessary to use bread of the correct texture and size. The bread should not be too soft and it should be cubed in such a way that each cube retains part of the crust. The cube is then pierced through the crust into the crumb. This prevents the bread from slipping off into the fondue.  This sometimes happens anyway, of course, and in Switzerland there is a tradition when eating fondue in a restaurant (optional depending on the crowd), that if one is guilty, one buy a round of schnapps for the whole party.\nA rule of thumb is to use 200 g (8 oz) cheese per 100 ml ( 1/2 cup) wine"

It is like pizza in that a thin crust of dough is baked in a very hot oven, but its topping is primarily creme fraiche, onions, and bacon. Like many traditional regional dishes there are innumerable ways of preparing it. Here is one example.\n\nIngredients\nStarter\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n 1/4 cup moderately hot water, about 110 degF (45 degC)\n1 tbsp sugar\n1 package yeast\nDough\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 tsp salt\n 1/4 cup beer (home brew)\n6 tbsp ( 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp) milk\nTopping\n2 tbsp oil\n1 medium (3 oz / 85 g) onion, finely chopped\n1 cup creme fraiche, commercial or home made (see note)\n 1/2 tsp salt\n 1/4 tsp pepper\n4 pinches nutmeg\n3 ounces bacon, cut into matchsticks\nProcedure\nMix the starter ingredients together in a small bowl, cover tightly, and set aside in a warm place for 30 minutes.\nWhen the starter is light and bubbly, mix the beer and milk into the mixture.\nPut the flour and salt into a food processor, then, with the motor running, add the yeast mixture through the feeding tube. Process the dough until it forms a ball. Add very small amounts of additional flour or milk if necessary.\nProcess the ball until it is smooth, elastic, and warm, about 45 seconds to 1 minute.\nButter a medium-sized bowl, roll the ball around in the butter, then cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled. Punch down and let rise a second time.\nWhile the dough is rising, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a nonstick skillet. Add the onion and cook, stirring, over low heat for 5 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool.\nCombine the creme fraiche, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Add the cooled onion.\nHeat the remaining oil in the skillet and fry the bacon until lightly browned, stirring constantly. Remove and drain through a strainer.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degF (220 degC) or as hot as it will go. If using a pizza stone, preheat the oven for at least 30 minutes.\nLightly oil a 14 x 16 inch (35 x 40 cm) baking sheet. Roll the dough until slightly smaller than the baking sheet. Place it on the sheet. If using a pizza stone you may roll the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper.\nSpread the onion mixture over the dough, leaving a very small raised rim all the way around, then dot with the bacon.\nBake for 4 to 20 minutes depending on oven temperature. The tart should is lightly browned and bubbling. Burned/blackened edges are traditional. Serve very hot.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nSome recipes, like the one used by restaurants in Strasbourg, do not use yeast in the dough.\nTo make creme fraiche, combine 1 cup heavy cream with 2 tbsp cultured buttermilk, stir, cover with plastic wrap, and leave at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours, or until it has become very thick. Refrigerate, and it will become even thicker."

The potato needs to be mashed very well indeed, and an electric whisk is recommended after the initial crushing of the potatoes.\nPour some of the milk into the potatoes so that the taste of fish infuses into it. The mash should not get too runny, but add some of the cream and grate some nutmeg into the potato as well.\nPut the cooked fish into the bottom of an oven-proof dish, with any remaining milk sauce. The dish should not be too large as it is nice to build a couple of layers of the fish, rather than lay it out in one layer. Once you have done this, pat the fish gently down a little so that it is slightly compacted.\nSpread the mashed potato over the top of the fish to a height of about 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) making sure it is flat, and not piled up in the middle. Using a fork, ridge the top of the potato as this will make it colour up nicely in the oven.\nAt this stage, if you want, add the grated cheese over the potato, and if you are feeling artistic, decorate the top of the pie with some large peeled prawns around the edge of the fish, and maybe a decoration in the middle.\nPlace the pie in the oven at 220degC and leave for about 30 minutes or so, until the top of the potato/grated cheese is nicely coloured and the potato is bubbling nicely.\nRemove from the oven and serve immediately.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nA good accompaniment to fish pie is samphire if you can get it (boil it for 10 minutes, add butter and maybe a little grated Parmesan cheese) or a lovely, fresh green salad."

This is where some gluten develops, so experiment with more or less whisking to your taste.\nPour the rest of the wet mixture in, and whisk to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.

If you mess up, no worries, just cook it through and eat it.\nWhen the crepe starts separating from the pan, you can flip it. If you like it crispier, let it cook more but don't burn it. You can flip with any utensil a few inches wide and thin enough to slide under the crepe. The hotter the pan, the faster it will cook. It's possible to cook a crepe in 20 seconds or so with high heat, but there's nothing wrong with cooking it slow on low heat.\nServe crepes warm.\nTo store, wrap airtight so they don't lose moisture, and refrigerate. Reheat on the stovetop.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nDairy free crepes: use Oatly or similar neutral-tasting non-dairy milk, and try some of the full fat variety to get the consistency similar what you can do with the heavy cream. Substitute 1.5 tbsp of a neutral oil like grapeseed for the butter.\nSee the base crepe recipe for more serving suggestions."

        "text": "Cookbook:Figolli (Maltese Easter Pastries)\ndesc\nFigolli (singular Figolla) are the typical Maltese sweet for Easter. They are prepared in batches and given as gifts to friends and family. The shape of the Figolla is traditionally an Easter related figure, but today one can buy commercially produced figolli in all shapes. See below for how to get the right shapes. This recipe is for preparing plain figolli, but they should always be decorated with either a chocolate covering or, more typically, with decorative icing. \n\nIngredients\nPastry\n800 g self-raising flour\n200 g margarine\n200 g white granulated sugar\n4 eggs\n1 orange, zested\n2-3 tablespoons water\nFilling\n200 g pure ground almonds\n100 g white granulated sugar\n125 ml water\nProcedure\nDough\nSift the flour into a bowl, and rub in the margarine until the mixture returns to a powdery consistency.\nIn a separate container, mix the eggs and sugar until well blended.\nMix the orange zest into the egg and sugar.\nFold the egg mixture into the flour mixture.\nIf necessary mix in some water to help the mixture form a dough. Add the water very carefully, drop by drop, as you will only need a little bit, and too much will ruin the pastry.\nFilling\nIn a small skillet, gently heat the water and dissolve all the sugar into it.\nOnce the sugar has completely dissolved, bring the water to the boil, and immediately remove from the heat.\nStir the ground almonds into the hot sugar solution. Mix well until you get a paste-like filling.\nAssembly\nFigolli Shapes\nFlour a clean surface, and roll out about a quarter of the dough with a rolling pin.\nCut two identical figolli shapes (see image) from the dough and remove the excess.\nSpread about a quarter of the filling on one of the shapes. Leave a 1-2 cm border without any filling on it.\nPlace the second identical shape on top of the first, making sure to align both shapes properly.\nPress the edges of the two pieces of dough all around so they seal. Wetting the fingers with some cold water can help if the 2 layers are difficult to combine.\nRepeat the above steps for the other 3 figolli.\nTo bake, preheat the oven to 190 degC. Place double layer of baking paper on a baking tray, and place the figolli gently on paper.\nBake in the preheated oven until the top turns golden and the edges start becoming dark (about 30 minutes).\nNotes, tips, and variations\nTo get the right shapes, you should use metal cut-out templates that are like cookie cutters but larger. Alternatively, a printable template is available. Print the picture on an A4 sheet of paper, then cut the shape with scissors. Stack 3-4 sheets of paper and glue them together for stiffness, or print on cardboard if your printer allows it. Place the cut-out on the pastry and follow it with the end of a very sharp pointed knife. While this will not give the finest results, the traditional Maltese figolla is expected to be modest in appearance, and only factory-produced ones are regularly shaped.\nThese shapes are a rather small size of figgola, so with the above quantities your figolli might turn out a bit on the fat side compares to what is typical. On the other hand, the larger the ratio of filling to pastry the more tasty the figolla tends to be."

They all probably taste better than this recipe, but this one has the advantage of customization, and is also gluten-free. You always know exactly what goes into what you cook yourself.\n\nIngredients\n2 tablespoons wheat-free low-sodium tamari\n 1/4 teaspoon yeast extract\n 1/2 teaspoon beet juice (for example, from canned beets)\n 1/4 teaspoon powdered shiitake mushroom (see notes)\n 1/4 onion powder\n4 ounces (110 g) extra-firm tofu\nCanola oil\nProcedure\nMake the marinade by mixing together tamari, yeast extract, beet juice, shiitake powder, and onion powder in a small mixing bowl. Make sure the mushroom powder and yeast extract are evenly incorporated with no lumps.\nDrain the tofu, pressing it to get rid of as much moisture as possible. Combine marinade with tofu, crushing the tofu into small pieces and allowing it to absorb the liquid evenly. Placing the tofu in a zip-top bag, pouring the marinade over it, sealing it, and then crushing the tofu with the fingers works well. You want no pieces of tofu larger than a fingernail.\nAllow sufficient time for the marinade to soak completely into the tofu, such as several hours or overnight.\nHeat a medium-sized non-stick skillet over medium heat. Using a small amount of canola oil--just enough to coat the cooking surface--saute the tofu, browning it to a golden color. Between the marinade and heat, it will achieve a medium-brown, but won't achieve the deep brown of ground beef or commercial ground beef substitute.\nOnce the tofu is browned, it will still be quite soft. You can improve its texture by spreading it out in the hot pan and allowing it to cool for some time.\nStore the ground tofu in the refrigerator. It can be reheated by heating it through in a skillet for whatever application you desire. It can be used as a filling for tacos, sloppy joes, meat sauces for pasta, and the like.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nRegular soy sauce or even tamari can be too salty in the end. Wheat-free is only needed if a gluten-free result is desired.\nSome vendors sell products containing a significant amount of yeast extract (such as rice cakes with yeast extract) as gluten-free; this source recommends avoiding yeast extract as containing barley. If you want to avoid the yeast extract, you might try increasing the amount of mushroom powder and beet juice.\nMake mushroom powder by grinding dried shitake mushroom with a mortar and pestle until no large pieces remain. This takes some time, as the dried mushroom is slightly leathery."

Gravlax is easy to make and makes a festive dish that is an excellent to serve at parties with many people. The process of curing fish in salt and sugar (grava) is not limited to salmon and works fine with any fatty fish although salmon is definitely the most common choice. Gravlax has been particularly popular and common in the northern regions of Scandinavia whose cold and fresh waters produce salmon of excellent quality. The basic recipe here has been used for generations and has its origins in the northernmost part of Sweden. Gravlax can be used either as a main dish or as an appetizer.\n\nIngredients\n800 g (1.75 lb) fresh salmon filet, approximately 2-5 cm (1-2 inches) thick\n30 ml (2 Tbsp) salt\n30 ml (2 Tbsp) white granulated sugar\n45 ml (3 Tbsp) juniper berries\n300 ml (1  1/4 cups) gin (optional)\n5 ml (1 tsp) whole or crushed white pepper\n20-40 g (0.75-1.5 oz) fresh dill\nProcedure\nCut the salmon filet into two equally-sized parts (if you are making gravlax for many people it is fine to use two filets instead). Freeze the salmon for at least 4 days at -18degC or colder to kill any parasites.\nAfter deep freezing the salmon remove it from the freezer and let it thaw, preferably overnight in the refrigerator. The salmon does not have to be completely thawed for the next steps.\nCombine the salt and sugar. Place the salmon, skin down, on a table. Rub the salt and sugar mix onto the pieces, then apply the juniper berries and pepper. Finally, cover with dill.\nPut one salmon piece on top of another, flesh side to flesh side so the skin it outside on both pieces, and place in a plastic bag. Add any leftover ingredients to the bag along with the gin.\nSeal the bag and place it in the refrigerator. Let the salmon cure in the mixture, turning the bag over once, preferably twice, a day for 4 days.\nAfter 4 days, the salmon is ready to serve. If you are not going to eat it immediately (it lasts a couple of days) move it to a fresh plastic bag or jar, removing the salty liquid that has formed in the original bag. If you keep it in the original bag the risk is that it may be too salty once you are about to serve it.\nUse a sharp knife to slice thin slices from the salmon at an angle. During slicing, also remove any remaining bones. The larger the piece of salmon the larger the angle and the larger surface area for the produced slices. Large slices look better when served.\nAs a main dish, serve with potato stew, boiled potatoes and gravlax sauce, or in a salad. As an appetizer, serve on crispbread or toast. Potato stew with some additional Dijon mustard is excellent addition to gravlax.\nSteps\n\n\nThawed salmon with the required ingredients.\n\n\n\nApply salt and sugar.\n\n\n\nApply pepper and juniper berries.\n\n\n\nCover with dill.\n\n\n\nPlace one piece on top of the other.\n\n\n\nSeal the salmon in a plastic bag and refrigerate.\n\n\n\nServe thin slices of the cured salmon.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nUse the thick part of the salmon filet found towards the head. Don't use the part closest to the tail, since it is not thick enough.\nThe gin can be substituted by lemon or lime juice (like a ceviche).\nThe time can be greatly shortened by slicing the salmon thinly before curing it.  It can be ready with as little as 4 hours of curing time.  However, using this method means it should also be eaten sooner.\nWikipedia has related information at Gravlax"

This is because chlorine (or chloramine) will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the chlorine.\nOnce the ginger beer is fermenting, as evidenced by lots of tiny bubbles rising to the surface, it can be used as a leavening agent. Simply replace the water and yeast in a bread recipe with ginger beer, and leave to rise as normal.\nIf left to ferment longer (about a week) a yeasty colony called a ginger beer plant will develop. Carbonation will also increase, greatly raising the chances for bottle (or other container) exploding; therefore, it is advisable to use a carboy or suitable container with an airlock."

At no point should the ghee and water separate. The batter should be of a very thin coating consistency, a little thinner than crepe batter. More water can be added if required to achieve the required consistency. Keep the batter in a cool place away from the heat.\nAdd melted ghee to a kadhai or other pot/pan. If desired, place a ghevar mould or other metal ring mould in the pan. The ghee should come up to  3/4 of the height of the mould.\nHeat the pan over medium heat, and gradually pour a ladleful of the batter directly into the centre of the mould in a very thin stream. The batter should froth and migrate towards the edges of the mold.\nWhen the froth subsides, gradually add another spoonful to the centre in a thin stream. If the batter builds up in the center, use a skewer to push it towards the edges and maintain a hole in the center. Repeat seven times, adding the batter to the centre hole each time.\nIncrease the heat, and pour a few ladlefuls of hot ghee into the centre to help the ghevar cook.\nWhen the centre is firm and cooked and the whole thing is golden brown, pull the ghevar out gently by inserting a wooden skewer in the centre and pulling it out of the ghee. Let any excess ghee drip off.\nImmerse ghevar in sugar syrup, drain quickly, and place on a serving plate.\nRepeat the cooking steps, using the remaining batter to make 9 pieces of ghevar.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nA mould is not required to cook the ghevar; if the pot containing the ghee has a small enough diameter, it will act as the mold to shape the ghevar.\nUsually ghevar is served with piping hot rabri, a variety of very thick sweetened milk."

        "text": "Cookbook:Homemade Tempeh\ndesc\nTempeh is a traditional Indonesian food made from soybeans. It is a fermented food, utilising a special type of mould that forms a cake. When fresh, tempeh has a nice mushroom-like smell and flavour.\n\nIngredients\n400 grams (14 ounces) dried soybeans\nWater\n2 tablespoons cider vinegar\n1 teaspoon tempeh starter (or ragi tempe)\nEquipment\nPressure cooker or saucepan, at least 3 litres (3 quarts)\nLarge tray (or trays) for spreading cooked beans on to dry\nBanana leaves, zip-lock bags or shallow dishes for incubating the fermenting tempeh\nSomewhere warm to incubate the tempeh at about 30-35degC / 86-95degF (e.g. your oven, with the light on)\nThermometer (optional) for keeping a watch on the temperature of the incubator\nProcedure\nCooked fava beans, inoculated with starter and ready to ferment.\nCover soybeans with water, and soak overnight or at least 12 hours.\nRemove the hulls (i.e. skins) from the beans by rubbing between both hands (see notes).\nSkim off most of the hulls either by washing them away or by using a skimmer or strainer. Some hulls may be left behind without affecting tempeh quality.\nCook beans until just tender, not mushy; undercooked is best for tempeh (see notes).\nDrain beans, and spread to dry somewhere with airflow (see notes).\nCollect beans into a bowl, and mix in the cider vinegar. This acidifies the beans slightly, inhibiting unwanted spoilage organisms during fermentation.\nSprinkle the tempeh starter over the beans and mix in well (see notes).\nPack the beans loosely into banana leaves, zip-lock bags, or shallow dishes for incubating. Zip-lock bags must be punctured at roughly 1 cm ( 1/2 inch) intervals to keep oxygen up to the fermenting beans.\nLoad the soon-to-be tempeh into your incubator, preferably on racks that will allow air circulation. An electric oven with a light on makes a pretty good incubator, because the light provides just enough heat to keep the beans warm while the fermentation starts happening.\nIncubate for 12 hours or so at around 30-35degC (86-95degF) with a heat source (unless it's already that hot where you are).\nAfter 12 hours, remove or turn off the heat source - the fermenting beans will be making their own heat, and may overheat if you keep them too warm.\nMonitor periodically from then on, and remove when the beans are totally consumed by fluffy white tempeh with no gaps.\nAfter fermentation is complete, serve straight away in your favourite tempeh recipe, refrigerate for two to three days, or freeze for up to two months.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nFresh tempeh at market, Jakarta, Indonesia\nTempeh can be made from almost any legume (beans, chickpeas, split peas), most grains, and some nuts. Soybeans are probably one of the cheapest beans to use, but more flavoursome beans make more flavoursome tempeh!\nTempeh can also be made from okara, the presscake left over from making soy milk and tofu. In Indonesia, this is called tempe gembus.\nThere are many ways to remove the hulls or skins from the beans, including:\ncracking dried beans in a grain mill and winnowing to remove hulls\ngrinding soaked beans in hands\nrubbing soaked beans between both hands\nrubbing cooked beans between both hands (but don't get burnt!)\nbuy them pre-hulled - e.g. chana dal, split fava beans, split peas\nSoybeans can be cooked easily in a pressure cooker at 15psi for 10 minutes with slow-release method, or on a rolling boil for 30 minutes in a saucepan. Soft, ready-to-eat soybeans are not the target here, so don't cook too long.\nIt can be difficult to distribute the teaspoonful of tempeh starter through the beans evenly. To make the job a little easier, mix the tempeh starter into a couple of tablespoons of rice flour first, then sprinkle and stir this mixture into the beans a little at a time."

        "text": "Cookbook:Homemade Seitan\ndesc\nSeitan is a food made from gluten protein that has been extracted from wheat flour. It has a springy texture, with protein strands similar to those in chicken running through it, making it a reasonable replacement for meat in vegan or vegetarian dishes.\n\nIngredients\n10 oz (280 g) high-gluten wheat flour (such as bread flour)\nWater\nProcedure\nAdd 2 cups water to the flour. Knead together until well-combined and elastic. It is advisable to keep hands wet so that the dough doesn't stick to the hands.\nCover dough with water, and place in refrigerator for 1 hour.\nGently knead the dough underwater until water is cloudy; dump cloudy water and replace with clear, cold water. In the beginning the dough can still easily dissolve underwater so it is advisable to only cautiously squeeze it against the bowl. Later you might find it easier to knead over the water, squeezing out the water, and only to dip the mass into the water to wash off the starch, if the mass contains too much water you easily wash out the gluten as well. The enriched water can be used to gain the insoluble starch, which settles on the bottom of the container, and what remains can serve as a base for grain milk.\nContinue kneading and replacing water until water remains clear after kneading. At the end, you should be left with a mass of gluten.\nDivide gluten mass into loaf- or roll-shaped halves. At this point, there are several things you can add to the mass:\nSoy sauce (recommended): traditional in the making of seitan.\nSpices: seitan can simulate Italian sausage by adding the correct spices, or adding poultry seasoning can make the seitan more similar to chicken or turkey.\nNutritional yeast (recommended): B12 found in some brands of nutritional yeast is a vitamin that is usually obtained through meats, eggs and/or dairy products.\nPlace gluten loaves in pot, and cover with vegetable broth or dashi.\nBring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer; simmer for 1-1.5 hours.\nRemove from heat and serve as desired or use in place of meat.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nTo avoid the washing process you can also buy 100% gluten flour in some stores. This flour would require only enough water to form it into a solid mass.\nSeitan created using just gluten flour can be rubbery and has a very \"gluteny\" taste. Adding 1 part garbanzo bean flour to 4 parts gluten flour makes for a less chewy texture and a better flavor.\nBecause of their high protein content, gluten \"steaks\" can be grilled and fried to good effect.\nWarnings\nFiltering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)\nA disposable respirator mask can help to avoid inhaling the hygroscopic gluten flour, which becomes very sticky in combination with liquid. The lungs do have a certain capacity to resorb organic substances inside the lungs, but one shouldn't try to test that ability."

        "text": "Cookbook:Homemade Cider Vinegar\ndesc\nCider vinegar, also called apple cider vinegar or ACV, is a type of vinegar made from apples. Cider vinegar has a unique flavour, coming from the apples used to make it. Some recipes require cider vinegar, although other vinegars may be substituted.\n\nIngredients\n4 kg (8.8 lb) fresh apples\nEquipment\nTwo 3-liter (0.8 US gallon) fermenters (can be large bottles or food-grade plastic buckets)\nApple crusher or juice maker\nFood-grade siphon hose (from hardware store or homebrew shop)\nProcedure\nWash the apples to remove obvious dirt, and cut out any bruised or bird-struck bits.\nCrush the apples, or put them through a juice maker, and collect the juice in one of the fermenters.\nCover the fermenter with a cloth, or plug the opening with cotton wool if narrow, to keep out dust and insects. Don't worry that the fermenter isn't full, as it should be for making hard cider. With vinegar, air space is good, as it brings oxygen to the bacteria.\nSet aside somewhere to ferment not too warm or too cool (about 18-22 degC / 64-72 degF). It should start getting bubbly within a couple of days. Note the progress, so that you can tell when fermentation has peaked and is slowing down.\nWhen the fermentation is slowing down and not bubbling so vigorously, siphon into the other fermenter carefully. Try not to get too much of the gunk that has settled to the bottom, or the froth on top--the aim is to get a clear cider without too many floating chunks!\nSet the second fermenter aside to ferment for two to three months. After a while, you should see a white film forming on top. Don't despair--this is the vinegar mother, a structure built by the vinegar-making bacteria (acetobacter).\nAfter a couple of months, you can draw off two thirds of the vinegar for use, and top up with fresh, clear cider made in the first fermenter.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nUse only glass, stainless steel, or food-grade plastic when making cider vinegar. The acids in apple juice, and further created by fermenting to vinegar, will leach chemicals from other plastics and corrode some metals.\nCider vinegar is better when made with a blend of apples including cider varieties--e.g. sharps and bitters, not just sweets--but pretty much any apples will do.\nApple juice that is free of preservatives can be used instead of crushing fresh apples. Just add yeast to get the initial fermentation going, and stir occasionally for the first two weeks to help encourage the acetic bacteria."

The dumplings were boiled and fried, and served with cabbage (sauerkraut), stewed apples or plums.\n\nIngredients\n1 cup (250 g) all-purpose flour\n1 tbsp salt\n1 cup (250 ml) boiling water\nLard\nProcedure\nMix flour and salt in a large bowl and add water. Knead until you get a dough.\nForm dumplings and add them to a pot of boiling water. When dumplings rise to the surface of the water, they are done.\nMelt lard in a heavy-bottomed skillet with deep sides. Add dumplings, and fry until they are golden.\nServe with sauerkraut or steamed apples.\nSources\nEbenseer Fotoklub. Brauchtum in Ebensee. Ed.

        "text": "Cookbook:Hamburger\ndesc\nA hamburger is a variant on a sandwich involving a patty of ground meat, usually beef (known in the United Kingdom as a beefburger), or a vegetarian patty. A slice of cheese on the patty makes it a cheeseburger, a common variation in the United States.\n\nIngredients\n500 g (1.1 lb) minced / ground beef\nHerbs and spices (optional; see suggestions)\nCheese (optional; see suggestions)\nVegetables (lettuce, sprouts, tomato, onion etc; optional)\n1 hamburger bun per burger\nProcedure\nShape the ground beef by hand into burger patties. You should get between 4-6 burgers from 500 g (1.1 lb) of beef.\nIf adding optional ingredients, either season the outside or mix into the beef before forming the patties. Overworking the beef will result in mushy meat that won't stick together, so only mix the minimum necessary and do so by hand.\nPan-fry or grill the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side for burgers that aren't too thick. Ensure your burgers are fully cooked through before serving. If your burgers are quite thick or if you are unsure, you can cut one open to ensure the insides are browned. If the insides are red, there is a chance that the meat is not fully cooked. Alternately, you can insert a meat thermometer into the center of the burger, if the temperature reads less than 71degC (160degF), your burger is undercooked.\nLet the burger rest for several minutes before serving to let the juices cool down and not burst out at first bite.\nServe each burger on a bun, optionally with relish, sliced pickles, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, ranch dressing, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and/or onions.\nNotes, tips and variations\nIngredients\nYou can add a pat of butter or some cheese to the center of each burger before cooking.\nYou can use almost any type of minced (ground) meat to make hamburgers, including pork, chicken, turkey, lamb, bison, venison, ostrich, or even a meat substitute such as Quorn. Some variations of hamburgers call for mixing different types of meat (e.g. ground beef and ground pork).\nOptional additions to burger patties prior to cooking include: black pepper, chili, Worcestershire Sauce, soy sauce, basil, oregano and parsley, minced garlic or garlic powder, onion flakes or diced onion, mustard, olive oil, cheese, butter, hot sauce, kosher salt, bread crumbs, and crushed crackers.\nDepending on the quality of your local beef, for example, you may wish to add some beef stock to improve the flavour. If you add any liquids, mix the ground beef well then squeeze out the extra juice when forming patties.\nTechnique\nDo not over-mix the meat--the burger will be tough, dense, and dry. If you mix herbs or spices in, do so by hand and be sparing. You can season the outside of the patties.\nBurgers can also be smoked on a grill. Smoked burgers will appear red and glazed on the outside, but browned on the inside. Smoking a burger before grilling it is an excellent way to seal in the flavorful juices.\nHand-made burger patties change shape during cooking, with the edges shrinking in toward the middle. This causes the burger to be more ball-shaped than originally formed. To circumvent this, press the raw patties down much thinner than you want the finished burger to be.\nLet the meat get to room temperature before cooking. This will help the burgers cook evenly and fully.\nDo not add salt until right before you start cooking the patty.\nIf your burgers fall apart, adding an egg yolk will help keep it together. Buying lean ground beef will also help, although if the meat is too lean the burger may be excessively dry. Not mixing the ground meat in the first place will also ensure the patty's integrity."

The theory is that the juices in meat rise to the surface of the meat and are then lost during grilling. By turning the meat regularly, you reduce the capacity of the juices to rise out of, and run off, the meat.\nThe egg and oats combine to bind the hamburgers and help prevent them from falling apart on the grill."

Yet these would-be discards still held enough flavor after a long simmering process to do justice to a hearty bowl of stew.

You only need 3-4 tablespoons, but you must knead the dough very hard to make it stick together in a ball. The more compact the dough, the better and denser the baati will be.\nLet the balls sit for 5 minutes.\nFlatten out each ball with first your hands and then a rolling pin until they are smooth discs 4 inches (10 cm) across and  1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.\nCook in a dry metal pan on a low flame. Flip once when the bottom begins to harden, then pinch all over with two fingers so the dough is not too thick and has a bumpy texture on one side.\nCheck the bottom until it browns in spots, then remove the baati and place it upside-down on a grate or pan with holes in it. This will blacken the top a little, especially on the tops of the pinched bumps.\nTo serve, drizzle liberally with ghee and accompany with a dhal or vegetable.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nSprinkle powdered sugar on after the ghee for a sweet snack."

Let it melt and caramelize, turning light brown. Pay close attention and don't let the sugar burn. Do not use plastic utensils to stir the sugar, since it will be at around 350degF (175degC).\nAdd the meat to the caramel and let it brown on all sides. Remove and reserve the meat.\nAdd the garlic, onions, and celery to the pot. Fry.\nAdd rice and cooked meat to pot with the vegetables. Whisk together chicken stock and tomato paste until smooth, then stir it into the rice mixture. Stir in the salt, pepper, thyme, and olives.\nCheck the seasoning. If the salt level is good, add an extra  1/2 tsp of salt. This is because the rice will absorb some of the salt, and it will come out a bit flat in the end unless you add extra salt.\nBring to a boil over high heat. Let it boil, stirring occasionally, until the water is absorbed. The high heat is needed to bring the rice temperature up so that it cooks. If you lower the flame at this point, the rice might not cook all the way.\nCover, lower the heat, and let it cook for 15 minutes.\nUncover, sprinkle 2 Tbsp oil on top, and stir so that the uncooked rice on top goes to the bottom. Cook for another 5 minutes.\nIf rice still not cooked, give it another stir and cook for another 5 minutes. Sometimes you may need more time; see notes below.\nTurn heat on high for a couple of minutes to brown and toast the rice on bottom. Sometimes it does this by itself during the main cooking so you don't have to do this. Experience will tell.\nServe.\nOven method\nPreheat oven to 350degF (125degC).\nProceed with the recipe as above, using an oven-proof pot, until the rice absorbs all the liquid. Once this happens, cover the pot, put it in the oven, and bake for 30 minutes.\nAdd 2 tbsp oil, and stir so the uncooked rice is on the bottom and the bottom rice is on the top. Bake for another 20 minutes.\nStir. If it is still not fully cooked, bake another 20 minutes.\nServe.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nIf the rice doesn't cook but all the water was absorbed, you can separate the rice from the meat, put it in a bowl, and give it 5 minutes on high in the microwave. Often there wasn't enough heat to cook the rice. On some stoves, once covered (as mentioned above), you may have to cook 20 minutes, add oil, stir, and cook another 20-40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.\nIt is also helpful to put a sheet or two of aluminium foil over the pot before putting the lid on. That helps seal the lid and keep the heat/steam from escaping, and the rice often comes out better.\nDominicans tend to cook the rice on the dry side--the rice will be cooked through, but not too watery. The ratio should be 4 cups rice to 5 1/2 cups liquid (some locrio recipes ask for 7-8 cups of liquid, which makes things mushy). If you have tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, you can use that also, as long as the ratios are the same (e.g. 1 cup tomato sauce to 4 1/2 cups water/stock; which makes a total of 5 1/2 cups liquid). If you halve the recipe, the ratio rice to liquid will be 2 cups rice to 2 3/4 cups liquid.\nSome people deep fry the meat separately, remove the excess oil, and then caramelize the sugar.\nThe ingredients of the sofrito vary, and can be made in advance. Some add cilantro, bell peppers, culantro, and other aromatics to it.\nOther vegetables such as 1 cup of cubed auyama squash are sometimes added with the rice.\nYou can also substitute guineafowl, rabbit, Dominican salami, pork chops, or other meat for the chicken. Almost any meat can be used, including cubed ham or spam, arrenque (smoked dried herring, pre-soaked in warm water to remove some salt, but cut the amount of salt you use), canned sardines, Vienna sausages, shellfish (mariscos) and if in desperation, ground beef, meatballs, hot dogs, etc. can also be used. You can use 2 lbs of chicken gizzards also, but gizzards need to be boiled (or pressure cooked) until tender first.\nSome people use Sazon Completo for the seasoning. Although it is not authentic, you can also add 1 tsp ajinomoto (Wei noSu ), which is similar.\nYou can take the skin off the chicken before frying it.\nInstead of chicken stock, some people throw in a stock cube."

If you would like to prepare your own lobster meat, refer to the recipe for boiled lobster.\nWhile the base preparation of Lobster Thermidor often remains the same, the type of wine or cheese used, or the way that the lobster is cooked differs.\nSome preparations include utilizing the broth generated from cooking the lobster with carrots, celery, tarragon, and wine as an additional ingredient to thicken the sauce of cream and sherry.\nReferences\n| \"Citizen Kane\"."

Mix well, then press it into the bottom of a 10 inch (25 cm) diameter, 1 inch deep pie dish. Press down firmly with the tip of a spoon to make the base.\nCombine the sweetened condensed milk and egg yolk. Stir gently, then mix in the lemon zest and juice to taste--more will be better, but be careful not to add too much or it will spoil the texture. Do not stir too much.\nPour the filling into the pie dish, covering the biscuit layer.\nWhip the egg whites until foamy. Gradually beat in the sugar until you get stiff peaks.\nSpoon the meringue into the pie dish, sealing around the edges.\nBake in a moderately cool oven (325 degF / 162 degC) for about 45 minutes until the meringue is a light golden brown. The aim is to cook the meringue and partly cook the centre (unlike, say, Baked Alaska, where only the top of the meringue is flash-cooked).\nRemove from the oven, allow to cool, and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours to set.\nEnjoy.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThere are 2 types of lemon meringue pie. The more common version has a lemon \"gel\" in the centre (which is often a luminous yellow colour), and a hard pastry base. The version above is much stickier.\nIn an earlier version, the filling used 3 egg yolks. It isn't necessary.\nWhen making the middle, it's essential to mix in the egg before the lemon. The acidity of the lemon acts on the yolk protein to thicken it; putting in the lemon first (which is tempting if you want to \"add lemon to taste\" without eating raw egg yolk) will cause the yolk to go \"stringy\" on contact."

        "text": "Cookbook:Moin Moin (Nigerian Bean Pudding)\ndesc\nMoin moin, also called moimoi or moyin moyin, is a traditional West African (particularly Nigerian) dish based on black-eyed peas or other beans. It is usually conical or cylindrical in shape, depending on the type of mould used. Some use small baking tins as the mould, while others use light transparent nylon bags. Traditionally, however, the moin-moin is wrapped in leaves of the Yoruba soft cane (Thaumatococcus daniellii). The leaves give the dish a sweetish aftertaste.\n\nIngredients\nAbout 2 milk tins of black-eyed peas, or other beans\nWater\nBell peppers, diced\nScotch bonnet chile peppers, diced\nOnion, diced\nAbout 2-3 tbsp palm or vegetable oil\nSalt to taste\nSeasoning cubes to taste\nHard-boiled eggs (optional), cut in quarters\nDried or fresh fish (optional)\nBeef (optional), in chunks or minced\nLiver (optional)\nEquipment\nOven\nGrinding machine\nPot\nSpoon\nBowl\nProcedure\nTraditionally, moin moin is steamed rather than baked. Steaming is the most common method used to cook moin moin and is considered the traditional way of preparing the dish. However, some people have adapted the recipe and started baking moin moin instead of steaming it. Baking moin moin gives it a slightly different texture and flavour compared to steaming. Baking can make the moin moin denser and drier than the steamed version. Both methods are covered below.\nSteamed\nPlace the beans in a large container. Cover them with water, and soak for about 1 hour.\nBlend all the peppers with the onion to make a smooth paste.\nPrepare foil or empty cans as molds for cooking.\nIf using empty cans, make sure their interior is clean, and lightly greased.\nIf using foil:\nTear off about 1 foot (30 cm) of the foil.\nFold the foil in half.\nOne of the edges is closed and fine. For two of the other edges, roll them a few times over to make sure they will take the weight of the mixture (at least an inch-worth of rolling).\nWhen you are done, the foil will look like rectangles with only one edge open.\nRub the beans between your hands to peel the skin off. The skin should float to the top of the container. Keep doing this until you have most of the skin off the beans.\nGrind the beans into a smooth, finely-ground, mostly-liquid paste.\nAdd blended mix of scotch bonnet peppers, bell peppers and onions, a few teaspoons of oil, a little salt, and the optional ingredients as desired.\nTransfer the mixture into the intended mould:\nIf using cans, simply pour some of the batter into the cans, making sure you leave enough room for the moin moin to expand.\nIf using foil, pour some of the batter into the foil, and then close up the last edge of the foil by rolling it securely.\nIf using the leaves, wrap the leaves into an open cone. Fold the bottom of the cone to prevent the mix from leaking out. Place some of the mixture to fill half the cone. Roll the top of the cone and fold it. Place the cone in such a way as to keep the folded portion flat against the cooking surface, which should also be lined with the leaves.\nBring water to boil in a large pot. The water should at least cover the bottom of the pot. Less water is needed if you use the leaves. Add the filled moin moin molds.\nLeave the moin moin to steam for at least 30 minutes until it solidifies.\nRemove them from the cans or the foil before serving.\nServe with rice, meat, custard, pap or other side dishes as desired.\nBaking\nGrind the peeled beans alongside the pepper and onion to give a smooth paste.\nAdd grounded Maggi, salt, and vegetable oil to the paste, and stir with a wooden spoon to make the ingredients uniform.\nPreheat oven to 200degC (390degF).\nRub vegetable oil in the muffin cups and pour the moi moi mixture inside.\nFold aluminum foil to the sides of the up to prevent the moi moi from drying up.\nPour water in an oven tray and place the muffin cups in the tray\nBake for 45 minutes, replenishing the water as necessary to prevent it from drying up.\nLeave to cool down and remove from oven when done.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nSome people recommend lightly grinding the beans before soaking them to make it easier to remove the skin.\nSome variants of this dish call for minimal or no removal of the beans' skins. The resulting moin moin is thicker than usual, and somewhat harder to digest."

Other optional ingredients for sweet versions include cinnamon, honey or a touch of vanilla, but piquant and exotic ingredients should be avoided, as the primary purpose of milk toast is to provide a food soothing to the palate and to the digestion."

Boil until the mixture becomes dark (about 5-10 minutes); the longer you boil, the stronger the chai.\nStrain into teacups to serve.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nLet the remaining solids cool and sprinkle them on your plants for an excellent fertiliser.\nTea masala or garam masala from a store can be used to get around the masala mixture process; however, pre-ground spices lose their flavor over time.\nWhen making the chai, boil the water and milk separately, and in step two add the tea leaves and masala to the boiling water, boiling until the tea is as strong as you like. Only then add the milk to the mix. This can speed up the process without affecting the flavor. This method is often used by restaurants to serve chai in large quantities quickly as orders are taken.\nOptionally turn off the heat in the end, cover, and let sit for about 5 minutes for a richer flavor.\nTry adjusting the ratio of milk to water. For a richer milky tea, try two parts milk to one part water.\nLeave out the sugar for a more adult flavor. Sugar can be added while drinking if so desired.\nTry other combinations of South Asian spices. Each region in which chai is commonly available has its own popular or traditional spice mix. One optional addition to masala chai is fennel seeds.\nAdd a piece of a lemongrass leaf (called lili cha in Gujarati), while the water is still boiling (before adding milk). This gives a nice flavor to the tea. Mint, fresh ginger, and/or holy basil (tulsi) can also be added.\nTo make ground ginger: Select good quality ginger and wash to remove soils and other foreign objects. Cut into thin slices. Spread evenly in trays. Dry under the sun or in oven under moderate heat or (70oC). Pulverize using blender or grinder. Pack and seal tightly."

Szechuan pepper has a numbing sensation, not heat.\nA little ground coriander and cumin is very nice in this dish, especially if you cannot find Szechuan pepper easily.\nA red bell pepper, a tomato, and fresh coriander leaves are all welcome additions, though not traditional.\nThe meal is just as good with whole beans instead of tofu.\nA vegan/vegetarian version of this meal can be made by substituting the meat with textured vegetable protein (TVP) or ground tofu (e.g. Shiok Food's Vegetarian Ma Po Tofu[1])\nExternal links\n| Shiok Food's Vegetarian Ma Po Tofu, original URL, archived original URL"

Let cool down before taking it out of the baking pan.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nIn Madeira these honey cakes are made on 8 December, which is traditionally considered the day of Mary's Immaculate Conception, because tradition says this cake is only good for Christmas if it is made on this day.\nIt is a custom to make enough of this cake in order to have some during the whole year. Once cooled and thoroughly wrapped into vegetable paper it remains good until next Christmas without losing quality or taste.\nAnother tradition surrounding this cake is that it is not cut with knives, but by hand, and also eaten by hand, nothing more than a tradition but very respected among Madeira locals.\nFennel is often used instead of anise.

North Staffordshire oatcakes are a local delicacy in the North Staffordshire (Stoke-on-Trent) area of England, and so may be known to non-locals as a North Staffordshire oatcake or Potteries oatcake. These use flour and yeast, whereas other oatcakes do not. When pre-cooked, they are a form of fast food, and catering outlets in the area usually offer oatcakes with fillings such as cheese, bacon, sausage and egg. They can be re-heated by frying in butter, or by grilling. In addition, pikelets are often served alongside oatcakes in a similar fashion.\n\nIngredients\n220 g (1 cup or 8 oz) fine oatmeal\n220 g (1 cup or 8 oz) wholemeal or plain flour\n1 tsp salt\n14 g (2  1/2 tsp or  1/2 oz) fresh yeast\n850 ml (3  1/2 cups or 1  1/2 pints) warm milk and water, mixed half and half\n1 tsp sugar\nProcedure\nAdd the salt to the flour and oatmeal.\nDissolve the yeast with a little warm liquid and add the sugar. Allow the mixture to become frothy.\nMix the dry ingredients with the yeast liquid to make a batter.\nCover the batter with a clean cloth and leave it in a warm place for an hour.\nCook the oatcakes on a well-greased griddle. Put enough batter onto the griddle to produce an oatcake about 8-9 inches in diameter. The surface will be covered in holes as it cooks.\nFlip the oatcake after 2-3 minutes when the upper side appears dry and the underneath is golden brown, and cook for another 2-3 minutes."

Place one such strip on the preparing surface.\nHand form the sushi rice into suitable sized sushi bases. Generally, this means a rectangular block about  1/2-1 inch wide, 1-1 1/2 inch (2.5-4 cm) long, and  1/2- 3/4 inch (1.5-2 cm) high. It takes considerable experience to form pleasing sushi bases by hand (beginners may find a plastic sushi mold helpful for forming the bases). Wetting the hands in water prior to forming each sushi base keeps the rice from sticking to the hands.\nFor nigirizushi requiring wasabi between the rice and topping, add a small dab of wasabi on the rice.\nAdd the selected topping on top of the sushi rice.\nIf nori is used, wrap one of the nori band ends up and over the nigirisushi topping firmly, so that it sticks to the rice and topping. Wet the other nori band end with a small amount of water, and wrap it up and over the topping so that it overlaps the other nori end. The water causes the nori ends to stick together.\nCommon nigirizushi combinations\nBroiled eel: sushi rice, broiled eel, nori band. Top with eel sauce and bonito and/or sesame seeds.\nSalmon: sushi rice, raw salmon\nShrimp: sushi rice, cooked shrimp (clean and butterfly the shrimp prior to using)\nMackerel: sushi rice, mackerel\nTuna: sushi rice, raw tuna"

If using fresh peppers, they should have been prepared by being boiled, peeled, and chopped. If using dried peppers, they need to be soaked in hot water for 1 hour before being chopped.\n\nIngredients\n3 lbs (1.3 kg) beef or other meat\n2 oz (55 g) beef kidney suet\n4 chile pods, skinned and blistered, or sun-dried chiles\n1 tablespoon dried oregano\n1 tablespoon crushed cumin seeds\n1 tablespoon salt\n1 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1 tablespoon Tabasco sauce (optional but frequently included)\n2 garlic cloves, chopped (or more, to taste)\n2 heaping tablespoons masa harina\nProcedure\nSear beef in a little cooking oil (not lard) until lightly browned.\nAdd the seared beef, suet, and chile pods to a large iron skillet or pot (at least four quarts), and enough water (the reserved \"pepper water\" if you prepared the pods yourself) to keep the meat from burning. Bring to a boil, then lower heat, cover, and simmer about 30 minutes.\nTake pot off the stove and add spices and garlic. Put back on the stove, bring to a boil again, lower heat, and simmer another hour, keeping the lid on as much as possible. Stir when necessary, but remember that too much stirring will tear the meat. Add a little more water if anything seems seriously in danger of burning (but as little water as possible).\nTake pot off the stove and skim off all or most of the grease.\nMix in masa harina, which \"tightens\" or thickens the chili con carne and adds a subtle tamale-like flavor. Simmer about 30 minutes more, until meat is done. Do a lot of tasting during this time, (1) to adjust the seasoning, and (2) just because a chili cook should do a lot of tasting.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nMany of the above quantities may be somewhat adjusted up or down, depending on personal taste.\nThe meat is simply bite-size--traditionally, it was the size of a pecan nut--or coarsely ground, with  1/2-inch plate holes in a meat grinder as standard. It must always be beef, venison, or other mature meats. Stewing meat also works well. Prime beef or veal, on the other hand, are not suitable for chili con carne, as they tend not to remain solid.\nMany cooks omit the suet as being much too greasy, although it does add flavor.\nAncho or Anaheim peppers are recommended. For an \"elevated\" flavor, use four pepper pods per pound of meat; for a milder \"beginners\" version, use only 2-3 pods.\nChili powder is a barely adequate substitute in the original recipe, but it lacks the subtle sting of the pods. A heaping teaspoon of chili powder is the approximate equivalent of one average-size chili pod.\nCrushed tortilla chips can be substituted for masa harina (this is what Alton Brown did on the Food Network show Good Eats)."

Put the butter, two tablespoons of the oil, the onions, celery and carrots in the pan and sweat over medium heat until the vegetables have wilted--about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and lemon peel and sweat until they're fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat.\nMeanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a skillet until it is near the smoking point. Lightly flour the veal shanks and slip them into the oil. Richly brown the shanks on both of the cut sides, then place them in the roasting pan on top of the vegetables.\nPlace the wine in the skillet and boil until reduced by one-half, deglazing the bottom of the pan. Pour this over the veal shanks.\nHeat the beef broth to a boil in the skillet, whisking in the tomato paste and anchovies. Add this to the veal shanks, along with the herbs, several grindings of pepper, and a large pinch of salt. The liquid should cover three quarters of the shanks. If not, add extra water.\nBring the pot to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for approximately 2 hours, turning and basting the shanks every half hour. If you notice that the cooking liquids have nearly evaporated, add hot water, about one half cup at a time. The veal is done when it is fork tender and falling from the bone.\nTransfer the shanks to a platter, remove the strings, and cover to keep warm. If the sauce seems watery, as is probable, place the pan on the stove top over high heat and reduce the cooking liquid until the sauce has a thick, creamy consistency. Pour the sauce over the shanks and serve.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThere are variations to this dish that use other animal shanks, including turkey and venison shanks.\nThe recipe calls for anchovies, which enrich the finished sauce without adding a fishy flavor. Don't omit them, even if you don't like anchovies.\nTraditionally, the cooking sauce is finished with a mixture of garlic, lemon zest and parsley called gremolata. It adds a burst of freshness to the finished dish. Gremolata consists of the grated zest of one lemon, one finely minced clove of garlic, and one tablespoon of finely chopped parsley. Add this mixture to the sauce at the end of the cooking, as it's being reduced.\nOssobuco is almost always served with risotto. It's one of the few examples of Italian cooking where a starch is served with the main course. One may, for a change, substitute orzo or ancini de pepe cooked in meat broth and finished with butter and parmesan cheese.\nReferences\n| Definition of ossobuco on Answers.com\n\n| Giada De Laurentiis' recipe for ossobuco on the Food Network website\n\n| Cuts of veal as displayed on Merriam-Webster.com\n\n| a b c d Info from Clifford A.

        "text": "Cookbook:Oat Porridge\ndesc\nPorridge (also known in American English as hot cereal), is a simple dish made by boiling grain (often rolled oats) in water or milk. Porridge made from Irish oats, also called steel-cut oats, takes longer to cook--typically 15-20 minutes.\n\nIngredients\n1/2 cup (45 g) rolled oats or other grain\n 3/4 cup (180 ml) water\n 3/4 cup (180 ml) milk\nProcedure\nMix oats and water, then bring to the boil, covered with a lid.\nOnce bubbling, stir and reduce temperature to the lowest possible to maintain simmering. Replace lid and watch carefully to prevent boiling over.\nStir every minute or so. After five minutes, remove lid, stir thoroughly and add milk.\nMix through, and keep stirring until fully mixed.\nServe and add raisins, sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, a pinch of salt, honey or inverted sugar syrup to taste.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nSoak whole grains over night and change water. Soaking softens the grains and reduces cooking time, although whole oats still require 45-60 minutes simmering. Rinsing also reduces starch and pesticide residue. Steel cut oats should simmer for 20-30 minutes, or to the desired texture. Let the water boil out for a chewier, rice-like flavor with whole oats or leave some water in as is common with rolled oats and instant oats.\nPorridge can be made using water, milk, or a mixing of the two depending on taste. Other ingredients may include butter, dates, bananas, apples, and cinnamon. Add apples and cinnamon during the cooking process to infuse the flavor. If you want to avoid milk products, it is also possible to use soy milk instead of cow's milk. Corn oil also works well with honey and figs, out of the vegetable oils. Honey itself combines well with apples and cinnamon while raisins, dates and bananas are popular with dairy ingredients. Winter squash can be added to finer grains like wheat and millet.\nPorridge was traditionally cooked over a wooden fire and in a cast iron pot which prevents burning and doesn't interfere with the flavor. In modern times, any pot will do as long as it is thick enough to distribute the heat.\nInstant oats are the easiest and fastest to cook as they only need boiling water and as this may be also done with a microwave oven."

        "text": "Cookbook:Pumpkin Pie I\ndesc\nPumpkin pie is a traditional American and Canadian holiday dessert. It consists of a pumpkin-based custard baked in a single pie shell. The pie is traditionally served with whipped cream.\n\nIngredients\n2 cups (480 ml) milk, scalded\n2 cups (450 g) cooked and pureed pumpkin (or plain canned pumpkin)\n1 cup (240 ml) maple syrup\n 1/8  cup (30 g) sugar\n1 tbsp flour\n 1/2 tsp salt\n1 tsp ginger\n1 tsp cinnamon\n 1/4 tsp nutmeg (optional)\n2 large eggs, beaten\n1 unbaked 9-inch pie shell\nProcedure\nPreheat oven to 350degF (180degC).\nBlend all ingredients except the pie shell together to make the filling.\nPour the filling into the unbaked pie shell.\nBake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.\nLet cool and serve.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThis recipe replaces much of the sugar normally found in a pumpkin pie recipe with maple syrup. Use only real 100% maple syrup, not maple-flavored pancake syrup, as their sugar content is different. You can also use brown sugar instead of maple syrup.\nPrepare the raw pumpkin by skinning and cutting into 1 inch cubes. Bake at 350degF (180degC) for 1 hour and then turn off the heat. Leave the pumpkin in the oven for another hour or two, which will reduce the moisture content. The pumpkin may also be steamed but may end up with too much moisture, resulting in a runny pie. A 10 inch (25 cm)-diameter pumpkin will make 4-6 pies. The pumpkin may also be baked whole and skinned afterwards.\nPumpkin pie has no top crust, which makes most forms of decoration impossible; however, for a more aesthetically-pleasing pie, put dollops of real whipped cream on each slice, or add a decorative rim to the side crust with artfully layered dough cut-outs in the shape of fall leaves, squash, or pumpkins.\nUse a smaller 'sugar pumpkin' instead of the big 'Jack O Lantern' pumpkin. Sugar pumpkins have a firm and smooth texture while the larger 'Jack O Lantern' pumpkin has a more stringy or fibrous texture and more watery flesh.\nVariations\nChocolate-covered pumpkin pie: After the pie has cooled, melt 2 oz (55 g) of sweetened chocolate (milk or dark) and pour over the top of the pie. Be sure to completely cover the pumpkin. Refrigerate to set the chocolate.\nPumpkin Pastries: Roll pie crust pastry thin and cut into circles approx 4\" in diameter. Put a spoonful of the cool pumpkin mixture towards one side of the center of the circle. Fold over the crust into a half-circle and firmly crimp the edges closed. Slice three small slits in the top for venting. Place on a greased cookie sheet. Bake only until crust is a light golden-brown, approx 10 minutes.\nSubstitutions\n14 oz (1 can) sweetened condensed milk can replace the scalded milk and maple syrup.\n2 cups of plain canned pumpkin can replace the cooked and strained pumpkin. Do not use \"pumpkin pie filling\", which has added spices. For a discussion on the use of canned pumpkin and the recipes attached, please see the talk page."

        "text": "Cookbook:Poutine\ndesc\nPoutine is common dish throughout the Quebec, Ontario, and Atlantic regions of Canada, made of French fries, cheese curds, and gravy. This recipe uses pre-canned gravy and fries the potatoes from scratch.\n\nIngredients\n1 L vegetable oil for deep frying\n1 can (290 g) of poutine sauce (French: melange a sauce poutine) or gravy\n5 medium potatoes\n2 cups fresh cheddar cheese curds or mozzarella\nEquipment\n1 deep fat fryer or large stove pot to fry the potatoes\n1 saucepan or cup suitable for warming gravy\n1 serving dish, with enough depth to act as a basket for the fried potatoes\nProcedure\nSlice potatoes into finger-width fries and rinse them well to remove any dirt.\nBegin warming gravy, keep the temperature low enough for a slow heating.\nHeat oil to 185degC (365degF).\nCook sliced potatoes in the oil for about 5 minutes.\nFollowing a first frying to cook the potatoes, they are often removed and then fried again for about 1 minute to crisp the outside.\nRemove the fries from the oil; optionally place them on a paper towel mat to absorb excess oil.\nMove the fries to a serving dish and put room-temperature cheese curds over the fries.\nPour the gravy over the top; the dish should be served before the cheese curds start to melt.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nFresh cheddar cheese curds (preferably less than one day old) and crispy fries are considered essential to heighten the dynamic contrasts in texture, temperature and viscosity for which the dish is known. Air and moisture seep out of the curds over time, which alters their acidity level and causes proteins to lose their elasticity. This causes the curds to lose their complex texture and squeakiness. Food safety practices require refrigerating curds more than a day old, but this suppresses the properties of their texture. Because fresh curds are not always available, mozzarella cheese may be an unavoidable substitute.\nThe sauce is traditionally a light and thin chicken gravy. A light gravy will more easily coat all the fries, emulsifying into the remaining frying oil and unifying the dish. A sauce brune which is a combination of chicken and beef stock may also be used.\nThe high dynamic contrasts make eating poutine a rich sensory experience. Even small variations--relative temperatures, the size of the curds, the oil used for frying, or spices in the gravy--can result in a distinctly different poutine.\nRestaurants that specialize in poutine, called poutineries, often have dozens of varieties, most of which add a meat topping with the gravy adjusted for balance.\nThere are many internationally inspired variants which replace some or all of the ingredients but maintain the contrasts of a crispy element, a dairy-like element, and a unifying sauce:\nReplacing gravy with  salsa, the cheese curds with sour cream, adding diced onions and tomatoes turns poutine into mexipoutine, an item also carried by the likes of Taco Bell under the name \"Fries Supreme\".\nReplacing the gravy with marinara sauce, adding either loose lean ground beef or crumbled sausage and replacing the cheese curds with mozzarella cheese changes the dish to poutine Italiano, served in several fast food restaurants in Toronto, Ontario."

It's a great mid-afternoon pick-me-up, either straight out of the fridge or zapped in the microwave. \n\nIngredients\n3-4 cups (~1 lb / 450 g) sliced leeks or onions\n3-4 cups (700-900 g / 2 lb) floury potatoes (e.g. Idaho, Maris Piper), peeled and thickly sliced\n2 quarts (2 L) water\n2 tbsp table salt or 1 tbsp sea/rock salt\nWhite pepper, freshly ground, to taste\n4-6 tbsp heavy (double) cream\n1-2 cups (up to 450 g / 1 lb) vegetables (optional), thinly sliced\n1-2 handfuls flat-leaf parsley or watercress (optional), rough chopped\nProcedure\nIf using leeks, remove the roots and dark green leaves; wash twice as long as you think necessary to remove the grit.\nPlace the vegetables, water and salt in a pot and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and gently simmer (partially covered) for 45-50 minutes. The soup is done when you can easily mash the vegetables against the side of the pot.\nPuree the soup using a food mill fitted with the fine disc. Optionally, pulse it in a blender just until smooth and pass through a fine sieve.\nChill the soup if it is to be served cold, or gently reheat it to a simmer. Refrigerate any left-overs. It will keep for days if refrigerated in a covered container as soon as it cools.\nAdd 1 1/2-2 tsp cream (or whole milk) per portion just before serving. You'll need more cream if you're serving the soup hot or if it's a bit watery; the idea is to create a smooth, silky puree, but you don't want the taste or mouth feel of the cream to predominate. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nAfter cooking the soup, leave it to cool in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours. It will taste better when heated up to serve!\nRaw vegetables should be added to the soup at the beginning of the cooking time; if using left-over vegetables or herbs, add them after the soup has been cooking for 30-40 minutes, so they cook just long enough to completely warm through.\nIf using \"regular\" table salt instead of kosher salt, reduce the amount of salt to 1-1 1/2 tbsp. A chilled soup usually requires slightly more seasoning than that added to a hot serving; this can be added individually to taste.\nA combination of young buttery parsnips and a couple of punnets of mustard-and-cress makes the classic French puree pasternak. A teaspoon of potato, rice, or corn starch should be used to stabilise the puree, which should be milled or sieved.\nUsing white pepper is preferable for color. Use fresh-ground black pepper otherwise.\nA proportion of light chicken or vegetable stock may be used instead of the water.\nSnipped chives are the classic garnish for leek-and-potato soup. When including asparagus, you can use steamed asparagus tips as a garnish; with broccoli, use steamed broccoli florets--you get the idea. Of course, if you're just pouring a mid-afternoon mug for yourself, who cares how it looks?"

Mix water, 3 tablespoons sugar and salt together, and add to the dry ingredients. Beat with a mixer for half a minute at a low speed, scraping the sides of the bowl clean. Beat at a higher speed for 3 minutes. Then, by hand, mix in enough flour to make a moderately stiff dough.\nTurn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (8-10 minutes). Cover, let rest for 15 minutes.\nCut into 12 portions, shape into smooth balls. Poke a hole in the center with your finger, and gently enlarge the hole while working the bagel into a uniform shape. Cover, let rise 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, start a gallon of water boiling. Put 1 tablespoon of sugar in it, mix it around a bit. Reduce to simmering.\nWhen the bagels are ready, put 4 or 5 bagels into the water, and cook 7 minutes, turning once. Drain them.\nPlace on a greased baking sheet, and bake at 375degF (190degC) for 30-35 minutes. Remove from oven, eat hot or cold.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nBroiling option: For a glossier surface, place raised bagels on an ungreased baking sheet prior to boiling them. Broil them 5 inches from heat for 1-1 1/2 minutes on each side. Then put them into the hot water to be boiled as above. Do not bake broiled bagels as long as non-broiled ones, 25 minutes should be long enough.\nConversion Notes\n| Volumetric values are approximate, and were adjusted to match procedure text. To conserve column space, tablespoons were abbreviated as \"T\", and teaspoons as \"tsp\". Conversions calculated from USDA National Nutrient Database data, as well as Google calculator (for the water weight).\n\n| All weights as grams were given in the original recipe text except for water, which was specified as 355 mL at (110 degrees F/45 degrees C). A density adjustment for 45degC was applied. \n\n| Bagels are typically made with high-gluten flour, and a low hydration of around 50-55%.\n\n| This excessive amount of yeast will result in a strong yeast flavor.  To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.775% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1.05% active dry yeast, although in all cases you can expect fermentation time to increase somewhat.  Further reductions will result in less yeast flavor and longer bulk fermentation times.\n\n| According to Wikipedia, \"Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, sugar....\"  Molasses is also sometimes used.\n\n| Important: this water for boiling section is based on water weight, instead of flour weight. This means it is not following the strict definition of baker's percentages, but instead a looser definition of analogous to baker's percentages.  It will keep the ratio of sugar or alkaline to water correct should you need to use a different amount of water, or if you wish to increase or decrease the sugar or alkaline concentration.\n\n| According to Wikipedia an alkaline is often used instead, \"boiling each bagel in water that may or may not contain additives such as lye, baking soda, barley malt syrup, or honey....\""

Scrape the wafer-thin layer attached to the stone with a spoon.\nCut each half of the sliced mango into 4-5 pieces. Each and every piece should contain a portion of the stone, without which the piece will soften too quickly.\nClean the cut pieces with dry cloth. Transfer the cleaned pieces to a basin.\nSprinkle the turmeric powder on the mango pieces and mix with dry hands.\nPour half of the oil on the pieces ,and mix well with your hands. It is essential to mix the pieces with oil first before adding any other ingredients. This will help the pieces to retain their firm texture.\nMix the powdered salt with the mango.\nMix the mustard powder, red chili powder, garlic paste, and fenugreek powder together in another container. Add half of the remaining oil to the powders and mix to a consistency that can be held in a fist.\nMix the paste well with the mango pieces. Add the remaining oil to the pieces and mix well.\nCover the basin firmly with a lid. If the basin used for mixing doesn't have a proper lid, transfer the contents to a porcelain jar or a clean plastic container with a firm lid. Tie a neat thick cloth over it and store it in a cool dark shelf.\nOpen the lid after 3-4 days, mix well, and taste it. The quantity of salt and chili powder needed in the pickle differ depending on several factors. Add salt and/or chili powder if necessary but be cautious in the quantity. The added quantities should be small to only tweak the taste and not alter completely. Those who want to add garlic flakes can do so now.\nTransfer the contents to glass, plastic, or porcelain jars.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nKeep ready a reasonably big ceramic jar or a plastic container with a proper lid. Clean and dry thoroughly.\nChoose the mangoes carefully. They have to be fully mature, yet raw, green, fibrous and very sour to the taste. A mango that is very fibrous will withstand pickling until the next season without going soft.\nMangoes must be cleaned and dried properly before cutting. The pieces need to be cleaned with a dry cloth but never washed.\nLet one person do all the mixing. That person should wash his or her hands and keep them dry. No damp object should be allowed to touch the ingredients at any stage.\nOn the first day of mixing, the oil may not be visible; however, on the third day, one should notice oil floating above the surface of the pickle. If oil has not covered the pickle completely and is not floating on top, add a little bit more oil and mix well just before transferring to smaller containers."

        "text": "Cookbook:Pesto I\ndesc\nPesto  is a sauce that originates in the city of Genoa in the Liguria region of northern Italy (pesto alla genovese). It can be used as a sauce for pasta or meat, or can be used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes. One classic use is to spread the pesto onto slices of bread before toasting. The word \"pesto\" derives from the Italian for pestle, pestello.\n\nIngredients\nPesto ingredients\n4 oz (100 g) fresh basil\nAbout 8 oz (200 g) extra virgin olive oil\n 1/3  cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or a 1:1 mixture.\n 1/4 cup pine nuts or nut of choice (optional)\n4 cloves garlic\nFreshly ground salt and pepper (to taste)\nProcedure\nPreheat the oven to 425 degF (220 degC).\nIf using, toast the pine nuts in an ovenproof pan for 10-15 minutes, checking every 5 minutes to prevent excessive browning or burning.\nIn a small frying pan (skillet), heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil on medium heat.\nCrush the garlic and saute in the oil until soft, about 2-3 minutes.\nCombine the basil, garlic, cheese, pine nuts and oil in a mortar and pestle until it forms a smooth paste, or use a food processor or blender and chop finely, slowly adding the oil to reach the paste-like consistency.\nNotes, tips and variations\nThe sauce can be used immediately, when covered with a thin layer of olive oil and refrigerated in an airtight container for one week, or when frozen for several months. The cheese can be omitted to allow longer storage, as it is the most likely ingredient to spoil. Grated cheese can then be added before use.\nIt's possible to store pesto in jars for longer periods, but it's advisable to add a little extra olive oil on top of the filled jar, otherwise the top of your pesto will turn brown as it oxidizes in the air.\nTraditionally, a mortar and pestle is used to make the sauce. The crushing action of the mortar and pestle produces a more intense flavor than the chopping action of a food processor. When using a food processor, you can simulate the additional flavor given by the mortar and pestle method by placing the basil leaves in a plastic bag and crushing them with a rubber mallet or rolling pin prior to use.\nGood quality Parmesan cheese may replace the Pecorino for a milder taste. Crumbled feta cheese also works well for a different taste.\nA common change to the recipe is to replace some or all of the pine nuts with sunflower seeds, walnuts, pistachios, or almonds.  This significantly reduces the cost of the sauce.  Besides being cheaper, it is also necessary for people with nut allergies.\nFor a creamy sauce, take 2 tablespoons of the pesto in a pan and heat on medium-low. Add 1 cup light cream and bring to a simmer. Use for pasta.\nThe pine nuts can be replaced with an equal quantity of sun-dried tomatoes.\nYou may change the taste by changing the base of the pesto from basil to other easily obtained herbs/vegetables. Some variations include using cilantro (coriander, for a more aromatic taste) or spinach (more \"bang for your buck\", as spinach is much cheaper than basil, yet still has its own distinct flavor).\nTry to mix up the standard basil/garlic combo by introducing shallots (sweet onions) into the mix, as they add a slight sweet taste to the paste.\nMix fresh chives, marjoram, and thyme with the basil to produce something akin to Valdostano-style pesto.\nAnother variant replaces the basil with equal parts of leaf parsley and spring onions. Arugula may also be substituted for basil with surprising, spicy results.\nFor another variation of a creamy sauce, add cream cheese to the recipe.\nA vegan variant can be made by mixing walnuts, fresh basil, olive oil and small amounts (such as a table spoon per cup) of white miso paste."

Nowadays cuisines of other countries and influence Austrian cuisine, but people in former times had only little choice about what to cook. This was particularly the case for the vast population living under humble circumstances. Although a variety of common professions existed in the Pinzgau region, agriculture and farming were the most fundamental.\nThe basis for food in the Pinzgau region was milk, potatoes, and corn, which were cooked and prepared in various ways. Meat was a seldom culinary pleasure, even for comparatively prosperous families. Meat was commonly preserved as bacon and occasionally eaten during days of hard fieldwork or on Sundays in dumplings. Rich families ate vegetables almost every day, and fruits were eaten by those who owned fruit orchards. During winter, dried fruits were used to stuff pastries. The famous fruit bread, particularly prepared for Christmas, still reminds of that tradition. The chance for a healthy and balanced diet was a clear privilege to farmers with landholdings. In the past, poverty was the major reason for under-nourishment and consequently for diseases and infections, and almost everything was used and eaten with very few leftovers thrown away.\nThe marmeladetascherl have their origins in those times; so just try them and get a taste of former times in the Pinzgau region.\nIngredients\n250 g flour\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n250 g butter\n1 package curd cheese (e.g. quark or farmer cheese)\n1 pinch of salt\n1 egg white\nJam (or nut cream)\nProcedure\nMix the flour with the baking powder, and rub in the butter.

But made properly, with simple ingredients, and maybe left to infuse in the pot for 24 hours, you have one of the most delicious and hearty soups imaginable.\n\nIngredients\n1 large dash of premium olive oil\n1 glass of dry white wine\n5 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped\n1 onion, peeled and chopped\n4 very red tomatoes, chopped finely or one tin (235 g) chopped tomatoes\n3 large squeezes of Italian tomato puree\n2 cans (235 g) borlotti beans\n1 handful of fresh, chopped spinach (optional)\n1 sprig of rosemary about 3 inches long\n1 large handful of chopped parsley\n1  1/2 litres water\n2 chicken stock cubes\n1 pinch of salt\n1 large pinch of freshly ground pepper\n1 large pinch of cayenne pepper\n5 handfuls of pasta shells or penne\n100 ml single fresh cream (optional)\nProcedure\nHeat the olive oil in the pan, add the chopped garlic and onions, and fry gently for about 3 minutes until translucent but not coloured. Add the cayenne pepper and mix well in the pan.\nAdd the glass of white wine and allow to evaporate slightly.\nAdd the water, the stock cubes, the tomato paste, pepper, salt, pasta, and the 2 tins of beans, and allow to simmer gently for as long as the pasta needs to cook (see packet) stirring occasionally.\nOnce the pasta is al dente, stop the cooking process, add the chopped parsley and the cream, and stir in well.\nAdd the rosemary sprig, and allow the whole thing to infuse for about 2 hours.\nBuon appetito Wikibookians!\nNotes, tips, and variations\nAdd a small piece of Parmesan rind to the pot once you have added the water. Take it out once you are ready to serve the soup. This adds a parmesany taste to the soup!!\nThe soup should be quite thick, but if it is not thick enough, take some of the soup out of the pot (preferably excluding any pasta) and blend it. Return the blended mixture to the soup to thicken.\nThis soup can be adjusted by the addition of extra beans, extra pasta, to suit your individual taste. As a general rule the pasta should form about 40% of the soup."

The recipe below is based on the one displayed on Spain-recipes.com[1] but with more ingredients. It requires some time to prepare but it's well worth the effort. \n\nEquipment\n38-centimeter (15-inch) paellera\n7.6-liter (two-gallon) pot\nRice skimmer\nSharp chopping knife for meat and vegetables\nLarge serving spoon\nPotato masher\nClean, white towel large enough to cover the paellera\nWide heating source such as:\nStove large enough to accommodate the size of the paellera\nGas burner designed specifically for paelleras\nCharcoal grill\nLow, forged steel tripod to support the paellera over a wood or charcoal fire\nCinder blocks or heat-resistant bricks to support the paellera over a wood or charcoal fire\nIngredients\nBroth\n225 grams ( 1/2 pound) chicken wings\n225 grams ( 1/2 pound) of any of the following: frozen seafood mix, fish heads, whole crabs, shrimp heads, smelts\n1 medium onion\n1 green bell pepper\n3 garlic cloves\n3.8 liters (1 gallon) water\n2 bay leaves\nPaella\nOlive oil\n1 1/2-2 red bell peppers, cut into strips\nSalt to taste\n340 grams (12 ounces) boneless chicken breast or tenderloins\n6 large garlic cloves, minced\n225 grams (8 ounces) onion, diced\n450 grams (1 pound) red bell pepper, diced\n450 grams (1 pound) tomatoes, diced\n1 tablespoon sweet paprika\n225 grams (6 ounces) canned beans (e.g. chickpeas, butter beans, great northern beans, lima beans; optional), thoroughly rinsed and strained\n720 milliliters (2 1/2 cups) Valencian rice\n1 1/2 tablespoons food coloring for yellow rice (see notes)\n340 grams (12 ounces) squid mantles, diced or cut into rings, shrimp\n340 grams (12 ounces) scallops\n24 live mussels, cleaned with beards removed\nProcedure\nBroth\nFill a pan with about 1 inch of water. Bring to a slow boil and add the mussels. Cover the pan and wait about 2 minutes.\nRemove the open mussels. Continue checking for open mussels about once every minute. Throw out the ones that won't open but save the water.\nTwist off the half shells without meat and discard. Put the half shells with meat in the fridge until you're ready to put them on the paella.\nCut the onion and bell pepper into quarters and place them in a large pot with the rest of the broth ingredients including the water from cooking the mussels.\nBoil it down until you've got about  1/2 gallon of broth. Occasionally press the ingredients against the bottom of the pot with the potato masher to squeeze out their flavors.\nStrain the broth and set aside. Discard the boiled seafood and chicken wings. If you don't like the idea of throwing out food then eat it as a snack but don't include it in the paella.\nTaste the broth. It should have a strong seafood flavor and moderate chicken flavor.\nPaella\nCut the red bell pepper into strips.\nPour a pool of oil into the center of the paellera. The pool should be about 2 inches from the edge of the paellera on all sides. Heat over a high flame.\nCook the pepper strips just long enough to scorch them.

The broth should have a very lightly salted flavor.\nAdd the rice and mix well. Once again, bring the broth to a rolling boil then reduce the heat to create a moderate simmer. Frequently mix the ingredients well to prevent burning.\nBegin tasting the rice after it's been simmering for about 20 minutes and reduce the heat a bit. Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center.

The toasted rice is considered a delicacy throughout the Spanish-speaking world.\nRemove the paellaera from the heat and cover it with a clean, white towel. Then, allow it to sit for 5 minutes, which will give the rice some time to absorb more water.\nRemove the towel, place the mussels around the edge of the paellera with the round edges facing down, and push them down into the rice. If your mussels have become very cold from sitting in the fridge then heat them in a microwave oven for no more than 30 seconds.\nArrange the pepper strips on top of the paella like spokes in a wheel.

This will give a shiny surface.\nRemove from the oven and let cool.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nSuitable flour types include complete 110 (high-gluten bread flour) or half-complete type 80 (all-purpose flour).\nIt's best to use chlorine-free water, as the chlorine is bad for the yeast.\nIn an oven with uneven heat distribution it may be necessary to move the loaves around halfway through baking.\nThe bread will keep for one week."

        "text": "Cookbook:Quiche\ndesc\nA quiche is a baked, unsweetened custard pie, often made with savory fillings. Originally served in Germany, quiche was adopted by neighboring France and is now considered a traditional French dish. The French (and now English) word quiche comes from a dialectal form (Kuchle) of the German word for cake (Kuchen). Quiche became popular in Britain after World War II and in the United States during the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIngredients\n5 eggs\n1  1/3  cup (320 ml) cream (approximately 30% fat)\n1 teaspoon chopped fresh tarragon\n1 dash ground nutmeg\n 1/4 teaspoon salt\n 1/8  teaspoon ground pepper\n1 prepared frozen pie crust\n 3/4 cup (180 ml) freshly-grated Swiss cheese\nProcedure\nPreheat oven to 375degF (190degC).\nPlace the eggs, cream, tarragon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend as briefly as possible until they form a homogeneous mixture.\nIn the pie crust, create alternating layers of the shredded cheese and the mixture from the blender until the crust is full.\nBake the quiche for 35-40 minutes; a toothpick or fork inserted into its middle should come out \"clean\".\nRemove the quiche from the oven, and let it cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nUse nutmeg sparingly.\nFresh tarragon will be better than dried tarragon.\nPlacing a very hot pan in under the quiche will give it greater volume.\nTry making quiches with sauteed onions, sauteed broccoli, and shredded sharp cheddar cheese; feel free to experiment.\nWarnings\nThe quiche mixture may drip over the edge of the pie crust while cooking; place it on a cookie sheet or place foil on the oven rack below it.\nThe quiche will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven; be careful not to overcook it or cut it before it has had a chance to set.\nHalf-and-half (cream with approximately 12% fat) can be substituted for regular cream to make this dish less fattening; however, be cautious of using milk because low-fat dairy products curdle more easily."

The whey has to be clear thus indicating the milk has completely curdled. Allow it to rest for 3-4 minutes.\nStrain out all the whey using a clean damp muslin cloth.\nFold all the 4 sides of the muslin cloth and twirl it gently so that all the whey that is in the milk solids gets evenly drained out.\nGather the cloth from all 4 sides and squeeze the chenna lightly about 3 to 4 times so that most of the whey gets drained out.\nRemove the chenna onto a clean plate and knead gently so that it is free of lumps, taking care not to apply too much pressure while kneading the chenna.\nIt is advisable to use this almost immediately.\nSugar syrup\nCombine the sugar, milk, and water in a large pan about 200 mm (8 inches) in diameter and 150 mm (6 inches) in height. Heat while stirring continuously until the sugar dissolves.\nWhen the syrup comes to a boil, the impurities in the sugar will begin to float on the surface, forming a grey layer. Do not stir at this point as the layer will break and it will not clarify the syrup.\nAfter about 5 minutes, slowly drizzle 1 cup of water form the sides of the pan with the help of a ladle. Water added at this stage will bring down the temperature of the sugar syrup and will not allow it to boil and break the grey layer.\nContinue to simmer the syrup over a medium flame for about 10 minutes and then gently remove the grey layer using a slotted spoon.\nBring the syrup to the boil once again and then slowly drizzle another cup of water from the sides of the pan using a ladle. remove all the remaining impurities from the syrup, again using a slotted spoon.\nIncrease the flame and boil vigorously for 1-2 minutes.

When the flour solution is added, a frothy layer is formed on the surface of the syrup.\nAdd the chenna balls by upturning the plate on which they are kept. Do not touch the chenna balls at this point as they are fragile.\nIf the frothy layer begins to subside, sprinkle the remaining half portion of the flour solution.\nAfter this, keep on sprinkling water (minimum 1 cup) on the surface of the sugar syurp. Ensure that the syrup froths all the time while cooking the rasgullas.\nCook for about 15 minutes, continuously sprinkling water to enable the froth to form.\nCheck if the rasgullas are cooked. This is determined by touch. If the rasgulla springs back and retains its shape when pressed, it is cooked. Another way of checking is to drop a rasgulla in a pan of cold water. If it sinks to the bottom, it is cooked.\nRemove form the fire.\nTransfer the rasgullas to a bowl along with 2 ladles of sugar syrup and 1 cup of water.\nCool and chill for about 3 to 4 hours before serving.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nRasgullas should always be cooked on a very high flame.\nWhile cooking rasgullas, the sugar syrup must froth continuously.\nThe sugar syrup should fill about  1/3  of the pan.\nWhile making rasgulla shapes (see variation below), always ensure that there are no cracks on the surface of the shapes.\nWhile cooking, rasgullas expand to at least 4 times their original size.\nWhile sprinkling water on the syrup when the rasgullas are cooking, make sure you sprinkle a little water at a time (about 1 teaspoon at a time using your hands) and not large quantities.\nThe cooking time of the rasgullas will vary depending on their size.

        "text": "Cookbook:Roast Beef\ndesc\nRoast beef, or a roast dinner, is a traditional and classic meal across Britain, the Commonwealth, and Ireland, with the focus on some form of roasted meat, vegetables, gravy, and Yorkshire puddings. Roast dinners are traditionally served on Sunday, but can also be eaten throughout the week. The precise recipe of a roast dinner will vary considerably from person to person, so below is a broad overview of common elements that can be adapted and made your own. As a roast dinner is a combination of a number of elements, below links to already established recipes to be combined into the roast dinner itself. Enjoy!\n\nHistory\nRoast Beef has been a staple of many countries diets for centuries, as noted, for example in the English ballad, \"The Roast Beef of Old England, written between 1731 and 1751:\nWhen mighty Roast Beef was the Englishman's food\nIt ennobled our brains and enriched our blood.\nOur soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good\nOh the Roast Beef of old England and old English Roast Beef\nIngredients\nRoast beef\n1 joint (about 3 pounds / 1.5 kg) of good quality beef rib or rolled rib beef\nExtra beef bones (optional)\n 1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt (rock salt preferred)\n1 pinch of ground black pepper (as much as can be held between the finger/thumb)\n 1/4 cup olive oil or other good cooking oil\n2 cups water\n1 onion\n1 glass of full-bodied red wine\nGravy\n1 teaspoon (45 ml) red jam (mix with a little water and strain out the seeds if using raspberry or blackberry)\n1 pinch of nutmeg\n1 teaspoon (5 ml) Lea and Perrin's Worcestershire sauce and/or Maggi stock cube\n1 glass of red wine\nRoast potatoes\n3 lb (1.5 kg) potatoes (preferably Maris Piper)\n1 tablespoon (15 ml) all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons (30 ml) goose fat\nRecommended accompaniments\nYorkshire pudding\nRoast parsnips\nBoiled or steamed green beans\nCabbage with a little bacon\nCondiments\nHorseradish sauce or creamed horseradish\nEnglish mustard (preferably mixed from dry ground mustard. Colemans in the yellow tin is still the best)\nProcedure\nRoasting\nOn the morning of cooking, get the beef joint out of the fridge, and let it stand to warm up to room temperature.\nPreheat the oven to 200degC (400degF) and place a roasting tin in the oven to heat up. If you have a spare one, place another onion in the tin as it heats up. Try and use a cast-iron roasting tin since it conducts heat better.\nCombine some plain flour, a little rock-salt and a good pinch of ground pepper. 'Dust' the fatty edges of the joint with the mixture, moistening the fat first by wiping it with a damp cloth, so the flour sticks better.\nIn a large frying pan, heat some olive oil, then sear (i.e. briefly fry) the fatty edges of the meat until they are a dark brown colour. You may need to hold the joint with a fork whilst you do this to ensure an 'all over tan'. It is a good idea, at this point, to brown the surface of the meat itself. This will trigger Maillard reactions (browning of sugars and amino acids), giving the meat a brown colour, and improving the flavour immensely. At the same time add the spare bones to the frying pan, and make sure these are also well browned.\nRemove joint and bones from the frying pan. Lower the heat, add the red wine to the frying pan, and deglaze it well. Be careful as the wine might catch on fire!\nUsing the spare beef bones, make a 'bed' for the joint on the bottom of the hot roasting tin, adding a coarsely chopped onion to the bed. The idea is to keep the joint a little raised from the bottom of the tin. It does not need to sit in the cooking juices. Add a cupful of water and pour the contents of the deglazed frying pan, including the onion, over the joint.\nPlace the joint on its bed, or on the rack, and put near the top shelf of the oven. Leave the meat to cook, without opening the oven for about 15 minutes at 200degC (400degF).\nOpen the oven and baste the joint. Reduce the oven temperature to about 180degC (350degF). You no longer need to baste the joint now.\nDepending on the way you like your beef, leave the joint in the oven for the following time:\nRare: 15 minutes per pound (~450g)\nMedium: 20 minutes per pound (~450g)\nWell-done: 25 minutes per pound (~450g)\nResting\nOnce the cooking has completed, take the joint out of the roasting tin and place it on its own separate dish.\nCover the joint loosely with lots of tin-foil, and leave it to rest for about 15 minutes in a warm part of the kitchen. If the joint can be stood up, sprinkle a very little rock salt over the top to enhance the taste.\nGravy\nPlace the roasting dish on the stove (if need be light 2 rings, one for either end) and allow the juice to heat up a little. Add the red wine to the dish, and thoroughly deglaze the dish on a high heat. This will also evaporate the alcohol from the wine.\nAdd a little water (if you are cooking vegetables, add a little of their water) and the Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a low boil.\nStir in the red jam, mustard, and nutmeg. If you are really feeling naughty, you can add some creme fraiche!\nContinue to heat everything on the stove, adding water (or cream or more red wine) until the gravy begins to thicken just a little. Carefully sieve the lot, reserving the gravy in a bowl.\nRoast potatoes\nStart preparing the potatoes about 1 hour before the beef joint roasting will be finished:\nPeel the potatoes, and trim them so that they are (more or less) the same size. Retain the peelings.\nPut the potatoes into a large saucepan of boiling salted water with a little olive oil. If you can, place the peelings in a muslin or cheesecloth sack and add to the boiling water to give the potatoes a little more taste (thanks to Heston Blumenthal for this brilliant idea).\nWhile you are doing this, heat the goose fat in a large metal oven-safe frying pan.\nBoil the potatoes for 5 minutes only--no more. Take them off the heat, drain them, and return them to the saucepan dry.\nImmediately add the flour to the saucepan and cover with a well-fitting lid. Holding the lid in place, violently shake the saucepan for about 15 seconds. The purpose of this dramatic action is to coat the potatoes with the flour and produce a rough and slightly spiky exterior to the potatoes. This will help them roast better and yield a crispy exterior. Using a large metal spoon, lift the potatoes one-by-one out of the saucepan, and place them in the pan of hot goose fat. Roll them around gently so that they take on a little colour. This may take 5-10 minutes.\nWhen they have all been in the frying pan, drain the oil from the pan, and separate the potatoes a little, or move them carefully onto a rack above a roasting dish in the oven. Don't place them flat onto a roasting dish or they will tend to become soggy. There should be a gap of about 1 inch (2.5cm) between each potato. This is vital to let air to circulate thus enabling them to become crispy.\nBake the potatoes in the oven with the beef. The temperature of the oven really depends on what stage the roast beef is at, about 180degC (350degF). They will take about 30-40 minutes to cook and they should have a golden brown crust.\nAbout twice during the cooking process, take out the tray of potatoes, and with a fork, gently turn them through 90 or so degrees so they become cooked all over. This is not as easy as it sounds, as the potatoes may have formed a crust, so work carefully. When finished, they will be crispy on the outside, and delightfully fluffy on the inside.\nThe potatoes will produce steam, so when you are ready to serve them, try and find a serving dish where the potatoes can be laid out next to each other, rather than piled upon each other. This will stop any steam they produce from making them soggy. Sometimes, laying them around the beef joint will serve the purpose.\nServing\nCarve thin slices of the meat. Serve with the roast potatoes, as well as 3 or more side vegetables such as roast parsnips, green beans, and cabbage with a little bacon.\nDon't forget some good quality (or better still home made) creamed horseradish sauce, and Coleman's mustard. Yorkshire pudding also goes very well with this dish.\nNotes, tips and variations\nBuying\nBest buy a 'joint' of Rib, Wing Rib or Sirloin Beef (I believe in the U.S. it is called Prime Rib, and is usually excellent) from a reliable butcher, and preferably not from a supermarket. If rolled, the Sirloin should come preferably 'bone in'. The word 'joint' is used in the U.K. to refer to any large lump of meat for roasting, whether or not it actually contains a joint (hip or shoulder) of an animal.\nA boneless 3 pound or 1.5 kg 'joint' will be enough for 4 people with some left over. If the meat is bone-in (still has bones in it) then double the weight required.\nAlso best you don't buy simply for the number of people expected at table. Cold roast beef is also delicious.  Allow for 'fridge thieves', cold lunches and at least 3 rounds of Beef and Horseradish Sandwiches in the days to come. So, let's be straight here, the larger the joint, the better!\nIdentifying\nAll meat, and in particular, beef must be well hung. At least 20 days, so the colour of the meat is more a dark maroon, rather than bright red. If a ribbed joint looks just a little shrivelled, that's fine too.\nMake sure your joint has a good quantity of 'marbling' (cream-coloured fat both around the outside, as well as some through the meat itself). If the joint is coloured bright red, steer clear. It has not been hung long enough. It may be cheaper, but such a cut will sacrifice quality.\nSupermarket meat has often been treated with a harmless chemical to make it look bright red, before it is sealed in plastic. It is difficult to determine the condition of such meat so unless you have no choice, buy from a specialist butcher.\nWhen to buy\nIf you're planning your roast beef for a Sunday lunch, please remember to buy the joint by Thursday lunchtime. Most butchers sell out fast thereafter as the weekend quickly approaches.\nWhen purchased, place the roast high in the fridge on a dish together with the bones and a quartered onion, and cover with foil. Turn it over occasionally making sure you don't drain any juices which may seep out. It's best not to freeze the roast.\nCooking\nIf you don't have extra bones to make a bed, place a roasting rack in the tin. Alternatively, you can sit the joint on roughly chopped sweet vegetables (e.g. carrots, onions, leeks, a small amount of celery).\nToo much celery will add a bitter note to the gravy.\nResting the meat is absolutely essential, as the juices, which has been drawn towards the surface of the joint will \"relax\" and diffuse back into the joint. The resting time also gives you time to make a delicious gravy and start baking the Yorkshire pudding, if that is required.\nRemember you need enough gravy for the number of people at the table, and they will take loads of gravy.... it's that good!\nCarving\nA large sharp carving knife is of course essential, and it may well need a little resharpening during the carving process (remember to wipe the blade on a cloth before re-attacking the meat lest you smother the first slice in metal shavings!)\nIf you are carving the joint with the bone in, it is regarded as \"de rigueur\" to carve from the outside of the joint parallel to the bone. Very difficult to do, difficult to produce uniform, thin slices, and extremely dangerous as often a small slice of finger or knuckle will add to the taste !!\nI suggest carving across the shortest cross section of the joint, with the joint lying on its side. It is much easier, neater, and affords greater control over the thickness and size of slices you carve. A purist may disagree, but who cares!"

        "text": "Cookbook:Risotto ai Funghi\ndesc\nRisotto ai funghi is probably the most renowned of all risotto dishes, and should ideally be cooked with porcini mushrooms when they begin to come into season in July in Italy. However, dried porcini (or indeed any other mushroom) is fine. Being originally a dish of the common people it's easy, and very tasty. \n\nIngredients\n250 g arborio, vialone nano, or carnaroli risotto rice\n25 g salted butter\n1 small (150 g) white onion, finely chopped\n1 large clove garlic, minced\n 1/2 litre chicken stock\n200 g fresh porcini mushrooms,or about 50 g dried\n1 small bunch of flat-leaved parsley\n1 cup white, dry wine\n100 g freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano cheese\nProcedure\nIf using dried mushrooms, soak them for at least 20 minutes in 200 ml warm water. Even if the instructions on the packet say they should be soaked for less time, ignore them and soak for at least 20 minutes. Once they have reconstituted properly, chop about  1/2 of them into small pieces and roughly chop the rest. There's no need to soak fresh mushrooms.\nMelt half the butter in preferably a medium sized frying pan or saucepan, on a medium heat.\nSweat the onion and garlic in the butter until the onion is translucent. Under no circumstances should the onions and garlic burn. If they do burn, throw them away and start over.\nNow add the rice and swirl it around in the pan until it is also coated in the butter. Leave for about 30 seconds. Again it should not even come close to burning.\nNow splash in the wine--it should fizz and steam dramatically--and wait for it to evaporate.\nAdd about half the stock slowly, one ladle at a time. Some feel slowly adding the stock is nonsense because they are off doing something else risking the rice \"catching\" and burning. Some feel it makes no discernible difference to the taste. Most would agree that this doesn't affect the taste, but does change the texture.\nStir the rice about every 2 minutes to release the starch and add more stock if there is the slightest chance of the rice drying out.\nAfter about 5 minutes of cooking add the mushrooms and their juice (or liquor as it is called). If using dried mushrooms, make sure to avoid adding the dirt that has sedimented at the bottom of the container in which they've dried.\nThe secret of risotto is that the rice should be cooked until al dente, which means the rice should have a bit of bite left, rather than be squashy and flaccid. This takes anywhere from 15-20 minutes, but be sure to start testing small spoonfuls after about 15 minutes of cooking. The rice should be fairly glutinous and not too runny. Ideally it should spread out on its own across the plate when served, not remaining in a lump in the middle.\nWhen you feel the rice is cooked, take it off the heat and add the chopped parsley, the remaining butter and about 2 tbsp of the Parmesan cheese and mix it all in together. Adjust the seasoning as well.\nLet it stand for about 2 minutes (the Italians call this the Mantecatura period) and serve.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nA good indication is a large cupful of rice per person, although that makes two cupfuls of cooked rice, which is a lot of rice to eat without adding mushrooms, onion, cheese and a nibble of salad!\nDried porcini mushrooms are almost better than fresh, as they flavour the water they are being reconstituted in with a wonderful mushroom flavour which adds to the taste!\nPeople have differing views on adding garlic. Mushrooms and garlic are a nice combination, but the garlic should never overpower the taste of the mushrooms.\nA common alternative is to add the mushrooms between sauteeing the onion and toasting the rice.\nTraditionally Italian risotto, and for that matter pasta, is served al dente, but for some people this will seem to be undercooked, in which case use more stock."

        "text": "Cookbook:Risotto (Basic)\ndesc\nRisotto is an Italian rice dish, most popular in northern Italy. Traditionally, risotto is the name given to all recipes that use rice as the main component and are served as first dish in a traditional Italian lunch or dinner as usually pasta also is. When rice arrived in Italy six centuries ago from the Far East, it found an ideal place for cultivation in the Po river plain and during the Renaissance and gradually replaced rye, barley and millet for its ease of preparation and nutritious power. Its diffusion across the country gave rise to hundreds of recipes containing components of different local cultures. But the founder of all risotti is the Milan risotto, also called saffron risotto.\n\nIngredients\n400 g (14 oz) risotto rice\n1 onion, finely chopped\n1 glass dry white wine\n25 g (1 oz) butter (a good rich butter is best)\nAbout 1 liter stock/broth (but it's a good idea to have more than you need)\nProcedure\nSweat the onion very gently over medium heat in some butter or olive oil, without letting it brown. This is known as a soffritto in Italy.\nAdd the rice and cook until it has a transparent look (this shouldn't take long). Add some salt and pepper.\nAdd the wine. A hot pan will cause the alcohol to evaporate more quickly (and create a nice dramatic effect), but make sure you don't burn the rice or the soffritto.\nAs the wine cooks away you will see the remaining liquid getting thicker as it's absorbing the starch from the rice. When it's more or less gone, add some stock. Do not add too much stock. The rice should never be submerged in stock. Keep stirring it and keep adding more stock as it cooks away. This should take about 15-20 minutes.\nTaste to see if the rice is done. The rice should be soft, but have enough bite to it to feel the individual grains of rice. The choice between a liquid risotto or a firmer one is a matter of personal preference. When put on a plate, it should spread out slowly. If it sits still, it needs some more stock; if there's liquid coming from the risotto, it needs to cook down a bit more.\nLet it rest for about a minute once ready.\nVigorously stir in the butter in small chunks at the time, tasting to get the amount of butter right. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. This phase is called the mantecatura.\nServe immediately.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nNotes\nThis is only the most basic risotto recipe. Add ingredients only at the beginning (through the soffritto, when they need to cook with the rice) or at the very end in the mantecatura (for ingredients that lose their flavour with too much cooking, such as herbs). If you want to use ingredients that require a very specific cooking time, like potatoes or broccoli, it's best to blanch them in advance, and add them to the risotto at the very end. It's very difficult to add them to the risotto halfway so that they will be cooked perfectly when the risotto is done. If you want the flavour of the stock to be present in these ingredients, blanch them in the stock. For some ingredients, like mushrooms, the cooking time isn't extremely important. These can simply be added to the risotto somewhere along the line.\nA common mistake in making risotto is to add too much of the extra ingredients. The star of the dish is the rice, and only very little else is needed.\nIngredients added at the last moment will be laced with butter. This can have a negative impact on the effect of some delicate ingredients, like garden cress.\nMake sure your stock is simmering before you begin. It's important that the temperature is as high as possible, without letting the stock boil. The surface of the stock should just be moving a little. A large thick pot is best for the risotto.\nWith risotto, practice makes perfect because there are many factors that influence the outcome. Experiment with several varieties of rice, choose the one you like best and then fine-tune the various parameters like cooking temperature, selection of the proper pot, the amount and timing of seasonings etc.\nWhat type of stock depends on the flavour you're trying to achieve, but since the flavour of the stock will become the main flavour of the dish, good stock is a wise investment. Canned is better than cubes or powder, home-made is usually best. Make sure the stock isn't too strong or too salty, as it will be greatly condensed. Make sure the stock is clear too, or the texture of the risotto will become gritty.\nUse a plump, medium-grain rice that contains a lot of starch, like Maratelli, Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano.\nRisotto won't keep beyond the meal, but rehydrating it with some soup or stock can yield edible results.\nTips\nThink of risotto as a way of making stock edible with a fork: the quality of the stock you use is the most important factor in the quality of your risotto.\nUse a different type of liquor to replace the white wine; vodka, whiskey, champagne and martini work well. Keep in mind that the color of the liquor will affect the rice. Using red wine will create a red risotto (which looks nice with fish or tomatoes). Rose wine will make a pink/purple risotto, which looks nice with asparagus.\nSaffron added to the stock is risotto alla Milanese.\nIf you are using some sweet ingredients, such as pumpkin, you may want to consider using leek instead of onion, to balance the taste.\nUsing large roasted  breadcrumbs instead of parmesan cheese will create a nice contrast in texture with the risotto. Put the breadcrumbs on top of the risotto at the last minute and don't stir, or they will soak up too much moisture and lose their crunch.\nAfter step 3 you can move the contents into a rice cooker with the stock and left to its own devices to finish it off. The end result isn't quite as good, but the saving in effort makes it worthwhile.\nLeft over risotto is not particularly nice reheated on its own. So as not to waste the leftovers, you can form day old risotto into cakes or patties, coat them in flour and shallow fry them in olive oil, making risotto cakes. This can be served with a salad.\nVariations\nMushroom risotto: Add mushrooms to the soffritto.\nCashew nut and cucumber risotto: Add chopped cucumber and roasted (unsalted) cashew nuts.\nFeta cheese and rosemary risotto: Add the rosemary to the soffritto and stir small chunks of the feta cheese through the risotto at the end. Use roasted breadcrumbs instead of Parmesan cheese.\nSweet pea risotto: add sweet peas about 10 minutes before mantecatura.\nAdd sliced mushrooms, sliced sun-dried tomatoes and shredded pepperoni before adding the wine. Add tin of asparagus just before it finishes, or fresh asparagus stalks just before the wine."

Serve them with butter, honey, or jam, alongside a hearty breakfast, or next to meats and vegetables. If you want a biscuit that is better suited for making sandwiches, consider the sturdier biscuits recipe. For a more economical biscuit using vegetable shortening, consider the baking powder biscuit recipe.\n\nIngredients\nIngredient\nCount\nVolume\nWeight\n\n\nAll-purpose flour\n-\n2 cups\n250 g\n\n\nBaking powder\n-\n4 tsp (20 ml)\n\n\n\nCream of tartar (optional)\n-\n 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml)\n\n\n\nWhite granulated sugar\n-\n2 tsp (10 ml)\n\n\n\nSalt\n\n-\n\n 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml)\n\n\n\n\nButter\n\n-\n\n 1/2 cup\n\n115 g\n\n\nMilk\n\n-\n\n 2/3  cup (160 ml)\nProcedure\nStop when the butter and flour looks approximately like this. The flour-coated lumps should not all be the same size.  It's fine if a few lumps are bigger than what's shown in this picture.\nPreheat oven to 450 degF (230degC, gas mark 8--very hot).\nSift all dry ingredients into bowl.\nUse a pastry blender or a dinner knife to slice the butter into butter pats.\nPut the butter pieces into the bowl with the dry ingredients and toss it so that flour covers the pieces of butter.\nUse a pastry blender (or a pair of dinner knives grasped side-by-side in the same hand) to cut the flour-coated butter into the dry ingredients. Stop when all the butter is smaller than a green pea (about 1 cm in diameter), but you can still see lumps of butter.\nAdd the milk to dry ingredients and mix gently until dough holds together.\nTurn out onto the counter or a flat board and form into a thick disk.\nIf you are working on a counter or board, sprinkle a large spoonful of flour on the surface before taking the dough out of the mixing bowl, and then another spoonful on top. Use just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking too much.\nIf you cover your work area with plastic cling wrap, you do not need to put any flour on the surface. Cover the top of the dough with another layer of plastic wrap to keep your hands or rolling pin clean.\nRoll the dough out to  1/3  inch (1 cm) thick. Cut dough in half or in thirds and stack the large pieces. Roll the stack out until it is about  3/4 inch (2 cm) thick. This stacking process produces the layers.\nCut into squares with a pizza cutter or into shapes with an open cookie cutter. If using a round cutter, press straight down without twisting, as twisting produces shorter biscuits.  Any remaining dough can be gently formed into a disk and cut again.\nPlace on plain, ungreased baking sheet. The biscuits should not touch each other. For a browner top, brush the top with a little bit of milk.\nBake at 450degF (230degC) for about 12 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nYou can use gluten-free flour substitutes. Avoid high-gluten bread flours.\nAmerican-style baking powder is double-acting, which works better in this recipe than European-style single-acting baking powder.\nCream of tartar will make the biscuits rise taller in the oven, but it will also add a slight bitter flavor if you eat them the next day.\nWhite granulated sugar is the most typical, but any type of sugar and most sugar substitutes will work.\nUnsweetened milk substitutes will work, but will slightly change the flavor."

With your fingertips, rub until the mixture resembles flakes of coarse meal. Beat in the egg and continue to mix until the pastry is smooth. Shape it into a ball, wrap it in wax paper, and refrigerate 1 hour, or until the dough is firm.\nWith the back of a spoon, rub the preserves through a fine sieve set over a 1-quart saucepan, then cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, for 3-5 minutes, or until they thicken into a thin puree. Set aside off the heat.\nPreheat the oven to 250degF (120degC).\nCut the chilled pastry in half and shape each half into a rectangle. One half at a time, roll the pastry between two sheets of lightly floured wax paper into a rectangle approximately 10 inches wide and 15 inches long.\nWith a pastry brush, coat each of 2 cookie sheets with 1 tablespoon of butter and sprinkle them with flour, tipping the sheets from side to side to coat them evenly. Then invert the sheets and tap them against a hard surface to dislodge any excess flour.\nPeel off the top sheets of wax paper and use the bottom ones to lift the 2 rectangles of pastry onto the 2 cookie sheets. Peel off the remaining sheets of wax paper.\nBake 40 minutes, or until the pastry begins to turn a pale gold. Watch carefully for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly. Let cool.\nWith a metal spatula, spread the raspberry puree evenly over one sheet of the pastry, covering it completely and smoothly. Slide the second sheet of pastry gently onto the first.\nWith a spoon, stir the confectioner's sugar, water and lemon juice together in a large mixing bowl to form a thin icing. Spread the icing over the top layer of pastry with the spatula, and set the cake aside to cool to room temperature.\nWith a small, sharp knife or pastry wheel, slice the Aleksander Torte into strips 1 inch wide and 2 inches long, cutting the ends on the diagonal."

        "text": "Cookbook:Sweet Cornbread\ndesc\nSweet cornbread is a variant of the Skillet Cornbread made throughout central and eastern Ontario and Quebec and is sometimes known by the alternative name of Johnny Cake.[1] Its presence in these southern regions of Canada is thought to be due to the influx of British Loyalists from what is now the Southern United States moving to the then-English-controlled colonies during the American War of Independence.\n\nIngredients\n1 cup (140 g / 4.9 oz) cornmeal\n2 cups (275 g / 9.7 oz) all-purpose flour\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n 1/2 cup (160 g / 5.6 oz) maple syrup\n 1/2 cup (90 g / 3.2 oz) brown sugar\n 1/2 cup (125 g / 4.4 oz) butter, softened\n1 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\nProcedure\nIn a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the butter. Soften the butter beforehand if you must by heating it a little.\nThe butter/egg mixture should be loose. Add the sugar and maple syrup, mix well, then add the salt to the liquid mixture.\nMix the cornmeal and baking powder, then blend them into the liquids.\nSlowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper cake batter texture. This should be softer than a cookie dough, able to stick to the mixing spoon and come off in blobs. You may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.\nPour into a greased pan, put into an oven heated to 200degC (400degF), and let bake for between 15-25 minutes.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nWhen mixing the batter, be sure it is soft enough for a typical cake; you do not want it too moist or dry. Use milk to fill in liquid you need and a half-and-half mix of flour and cornmeal if you are too moist.\nKeep a close eye on the cake while it bakes: it will become hard fast if you do not take it out in time.\nIf you want to make a crisper crust take a 3 part mix of equal volumes of flour, cornmeal and brown sugar, mix well. Add to the top of the cake half way into the baking process, but do this very quickly: leaving the door open too long will make your cake a rock.  The amount required varies based on the pan you use, so use your eyes for what you need (less than a cup total).  Despite the call for opening it halfway through baking, adding it at the beginning should work fine as well.\nYou can substitute honey for the maple syrup, or plain sugar. Maple is used for its flavouring as much as its sweetness.\nMargarine or vegetable oil will do as well as butter for this. Butter was used traditionally and is thus listed.\nThis dish is usually made for after meals and outside them rather than with them, which is how its cousin  Skillet Cornbread is used.  However, when having  Maple Beans and Ham, Sweet Cornbread is often served with it.\nReferences\n| \"Johnny-cake\". Oxford English Dictionary. 1989."

        "text": "Cookbook:Sushi Rice\ndesc\nSushi rice, termed sushi meshi or shari in Japanese, is a key ingredient for sushi and a staple of Japanese cooking. It consists of short-grain rice dressed with seasoned vinegar called sushisu. The rice is then cooled and dried for easy manipulation and to give a glistening appearance. The Japanese measure their uncooked rice using a measurement called a Go. This is roughly equivalent to 150 grams when used to measure Japanese rice. One Go is also the standard size of a rice cooker's measuring cup.\n\nIngredients\nRice\n2 go (300 g) uncooked, washed, short-grain Japanese rice\n400 ml water\n1 small sheet of kombu (optional)\n1 metric tablespoon (15 ml) sake (optional)\nSushisu\n3 metric tablespoons (45 ml) of rice vinegar\n1-2 metric tablespoons (12-24 g) of sugar (depending on how sweet you prefer it)\n1-1.5 metric teaspoons of sea salt\nEquipment\nRice cooker\nHangiri (rice barrel; optional)\nShamoji (rice paddle; optional)\nFukin (cloth; optional)\nSensu (fan; optional)\nProcedure\nAbout 30 minutes before starting, fill the hangiri with water and let it stand. The water saturates the wood, which prevents the rice from sticking to it.\nMake the sushisu: Mix the vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat the mixture in a saucepan until everything is dissolved, but do not boil. Set aside to cool.\nRinse the rice. Put the rice in the cooking pot, half filled with cold water, and swirl it around with your hand. The water will turn chalky white. Carefully drain off the water, and repeat the process several times, until the water remains clear.\nAllow the rice to stand for 30 minutes. Some recipes say the rice should remain in the cooking pot submerged in its cooking water; others say to transfer it temporarily to a colander to drain.\nAdd an 8 cm-sized sheet of kombu to the cooking pot, along with the sake if you are using it.\nBoil the water in the cooking pot.\nRemove the kombu from the cooking pot just as the water boils, and reduce the heat. Simmer the water and rice in the cooking pot for 20 minutes.\nTurn off the heat but do not remove cover from the cooking pot for 10 minutes (no peeking).\nTransfer the rice from the cooking pot to the hangiri; if you do not have one, use a large bowl or cookie sheet.\nCut the sushisu gently into rice with the paddle, trying not to break the kernels. For Western chefs: this \"cutting\" motion is similar to the cut-and-fold used for gentle treatment of egg whites. When finished, the rice is evenly coated with the dressing, giving it a shiny appearance.\nCover the rice with a cloth for a couple of minutes so the dressing is absorbed.\nCool the rice to body temperature by fanning it, while continuing to cut it with the spatula. A traditional hand fan or modern battery-powered fan may be used.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nA rice-cooker is often used instead of a cooking pot; these generally produce good, consistent results. The manufacturer's directions will generally be similar to the above.\nThe rice and sushisu should be mixed immediately after the rice is finished cooking with sushisu at room temperature.\nSome sushi chefs prefer natural cooling, rather than fanning, and instead let the rice rest in the hangiri for 15 minutes, then re-cut the rice, and continue with this process until the rice is cool.\nAccording to some, the faster the rice cools, the better (but see above about natural cooling, which yields a slightly different texture). The rice is best if used quickly: you can use it to make sushi for a few hours; it certainly cannot be prepared a day early."

Keep adding little bits of the water until the butter has absorbed it all.\nSift the flour, baking powder and the salt all together and add this through the butter gradually. To see if the dough is rollable, press your finger on it and if the dough doesn't stick to it, it's fine.

After a minute add the chopped tomatoes, the peas and carrots, and the celery. Every so often, add a little bit of the chicken broth to the pan so that it won't burn.\nAdd the chopped pickles.\nAfter all the broth has been added and the whole seems good, taste to see if it has enough salt; if not, add some. Cool slightly, then mix in the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.\nTransfer the chicken mixture to the dough-lined pan until it is nicely filled.\nSlice the boiled eggs and place them on top of the filling in the pan.\nTop the mixture with the second sheet of dough. Seal the edges as best as possible.\nPut the pastei in a preheated oven, and bake for about  3/4 hour.\nA few minutes before you take it out of the oven, you can lightly brush the top with some whisked egg to make the top shiny and a little crisp.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nIf you're on a tight schedule, store-bough puff pastry works just as well, so you can use that instead of making your own dough."

        "text": "Cookbook:Strawberry Dumplings\ndesc\nStrawberry dumplings (erdbeerknodel) are a typically Austrian dish usually served as a main course, rather than as a dessert. This recipe is a tasteful, quick, and easy dish for, say, an evening with in-laws. Cooking strawberry dumplings is relatively easy, but of course it can only be perfected by practice. If you have grown tired of strawberry dumplings, just vary the filling and use other fruits of your choice. \n\nIngredients\n1/5 cup (50 g) butter\n4/5 cups (200 g) breadcrumbs\n1/5 cup (50 g) white granulated sugar\n1 egg\n2 cups (500 g) curd cheese (e.g. quark, pot cheese, or farmer cheese)\n1 pinch of salt\n 1/2 cup (125 g) flour\n12 ripe, medium-sized strawberries, rinsed and trimmed\nIcing sugar\nProcedure\nBreadcrumbs\nMelt the butter in a frying pan.\nAdd the breadcrumbs and the sugar and toast them until they gain a brown colour. Stir well, as the sugar makes the crumbs burn faster.\nDough\nPut the egg and the curd cheese into a large bowl.\nAdd a pinch of salt.\nStir until the mixture is smooth; the egg and the cheese should be blended well.\nSlowly add the flour, stirring until the dough sticks to one side of the bowl.\nLet the dough rest for about 5 minutes. If the dough is too moist, which sometimes happens due to the salt, add some more flour.\nAssembly\nCover your hands with flour, so that the dough won't stick to your fingers when forming the dumplings.\nTake a large tablespoon of dough and put it onto your palm.\nAdd some flour and roll the dough slightly between your hands until you receive a small ball.\nPress the ball flat and put a strawberry into the middle. Cover the strawberry with dough, and pinch to seal.\nSprinkle the dumpling and your hands with some more flour. Carefully roll the dumpling until you get a smooth, round ball.\nPut the dumplings on a floured plate. Leave enough space between them, as they will otherwise stick to one another.\nCooking\nFill a large pot with about 3 liters of water and bring it to a boil.\nPut the dumplings into the boiling water. Let them boil in the open pot for about 10 minutes. The dumplings are done, when they float as if they \"danced\".\nTake the dumplings out of the boiling water and roll them in the breadcrumbs until they are covered evenly. Since the crumbs are supposed to stick, the dumplings should still be moist on the surface.\nServe the dumplings together with a little of the roasted crumbs, and sprinkle them with icing sugar\nNotes, tips, and variations\nAlways use fresh, ripe strawberries, as they taste much sweeter than the ones you can buy in the supermarket. Also consider picking strawberries yourself; this way you can choose the ripe and fresh ones and get the size you need for the dumplings. Moreover, you can try a few while picking. Use the spare strawberries for making jam.\nThe breadcrumbs can be toasted without sugar, but in this case you will miss on the caramel flavor. You can also roast the breadcrumbs without butter.\nThis recipe also works well with other fillings like apricots, plums, or chocolate. In Austria the dumplings are also filled with \"Mozartkugeln\", which are little balls of chocolate, nougat, and almond paste. If you use apricots or plums as a filling, you can add a pinch of cinnamon to the sugar before mixing it with the breadcrumbs. If you serve dumplings with a chocolate filling, garnish them with chocolate sauce and ground walnuts.\nIt is a good idea to serve the dumplings with ice cream (preferably vanilla flavor), garnished with fresh berries and a mint leaf.\nEnjoying a glass of cold milk together with the dumplings is especially refreshing in the summer months. In Austria it is also common to serve sweet dishes with a cup of coffee.\nCurd cheese dough only tastes well with sweet fillings. For savory dumplings, which are very popular in Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic, use potato dough and no breadcrumbs."

The slices should be quite thin.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil on a low heat in a large saute pan\nAdd the potatoes to the saute pan, and fry until soft and cooked through, but not browned. This can take quite a while--don't rush it. It is a good idea to keep the pan covered so the steam from the potatoes at the bottom of the pan helps cook the ones at the top.\nSlice the onion thinly. Fry it lightly in frying pan, stirring frequently for a few minutes or until sweet. Or you can simply add them to the potatoes for the last five minutes of cooking.\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl and add salt.\nAdd the hot cooked potatoes and onion to the egg in the bowl, gently mix the potatoes and onion into the egg and leave it for five minutes. This starts the egg cooking and helps cover the potato slices in egg so it all sticks together nicely.\nDrain oil, reserving oil for another time.\nPour the potatoes, onion and egg mix back into the pan, and cook for about 5 minutes on a low heat. Keep the pan moving so the mix doesn't stick to the pan. A non-stick pan makes this much easier.\nWhen the edge of the tortilla looks cooked place a large, flat plate over the pan (like a lid), put one hand on the plate to hold it in place and turn the whole thing over (the first few times you do this it is best do this over the sink--can be very messy).\nYou should now have an up-side-down omelette on your plate, cooked on top and raw underneath. Check the pan is clean and scrape any bits that have stuck in the pan off and add a bit of oil if it is looking dry. Now slide the omelette back into the pan to cook the bottom.\nCook for another few minutes,\nRepeat the turning trick a couple of times (practice makes perfect) to make sure it is cooked evenly.\nTransfer to a large plate, cut into wedges, and serve with more tapas.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nSliced tomatoes, fresh bread, and mayonnaise make this into a great meal."

If making bulk recipes, be sure to simmer for hours, or even a full day, occasionally stirring up from the bottom of the large pot to ensure the contents at the bottom does not burn, adding stock as needed to keep the right consistency. The goal is to have the flavours mix and make the home smell delicious!\nNever rinse pasta with water. To ensure there is no excess starch from the pasta, choose a high quality durum wheat pasta and boil it in lots of water."

        "text": "Cookbook:Spaghetti alla Carbonara\ndesc\nRecipes vary, though all agree that pecorino romano, eggs, cured fatty pork, and black pepper are the basics. The pork is fried in fat (olive oil or lard). Then, a mixture of eggs, cheese and olive oil is combined with the hot pasta, thereby cooking the eggs. All of the ingredients are then mixed together.[1][2][3] Guanciale is the most traditional cured pork cut for this recipe, but pancetta is a popular substitute.[4][5] In the US, it is often made with American bacon.\n\nHistory\nLike most recipes, the origins of the dish are obscure but there are many legends. As 'carbonara' literally means 'coal miner's wife', some believe that the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian coal miners. Others say that it was originally made over charcoal grills, or that it was made with squid ink, giving it the color of coal. It has even been suggested that it was created by, or as a tribute to, the \"charcoalmen\", a secret society prominent in the unification of Italy. Also, the name may be from a Roman restaurant named Carbonara.[12][13]\nThe dish is not present in Ada Boni's 1927 classic La Cucina Romana, and is unrecorded before the Second World War. It was first recorded after the war as a Roman dish, when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by American troops.\nIngredients\n450 g (1 pound) spaghetti\n225-500 g ( 1/2-1 pound) guanciale or pancetta\n5 egg yolks\n178 ml ( 3/4 cup) grated Pecorino Romano cheese\n178 ml ( 3/4 cup) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese\n3-4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n 1/2 tablespoon freshly-ground pepper\nSalt\nEquipment\nLarge pot\nLarge skillet\nBowl\nMeasuring cups and spoons\nFork\nProcedure\nDice the guanciale or pancetta into 2.5 cm (1-inch) pieces.\nBring a big pot of water to a boil and add salt to taste when it begins to simmer.\nCook the spaghetti until it is al dente and drain it, reserving 1 cup of water.\nWhile spaghetti is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook for about 10 minutes over a low flame until the pancetta has rendered most of its fat but is still chewy and barely browned.\nIn a bowl, slowly whisk about  1/2 cup of the pasta water into the egg yolks. Add the grated cheese and mix thoroughly with a fork.\nStrain the spaghetti and transfer it immediately to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss it and turn off the heat.\nAdd the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta while stirring in the remaining pasta water to help thin the sauce and create an emulsion.\nAdd the pepper and toss all the ingredients to coat the pasta.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nIdeally this dish is served with a red wine (Merlot, Chianti, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo), allowed to decant for several hours, and served at 65degF (18degC).\nSee also\nCarbonara pasta sauce\nReferences\n| a b Alberini, Massimo (1984).

Thus the easiest way to get starter is find someone with it, and borrow a small amount and increase it. If you wish to have a starter other than whatever is local, this is the only way to get it.\nYou can get a free sourdough starter that has been kept alive for 150 years from the Friends of Carl Griffith.\nMaking your own starter\nIf you cannot find a source of starter it is easy to make your own.\nKey concepts\nSeveral key concepts are needed for understanding the sourdough production process. In what follows, recipe by volume measures are probably familiar.  Measurement of the ingredients by weight, and any notation system used may be new and unfamiliar. Such notation systems are actually very simple, and it is recommended you familiarize yourself with them.\nTwo types of sourdough starter\nIn the most basic sense, there are two types of sourdough used in baking. One type is used in acid-base reactions to form leavening gas, such as sourdough quick breads or pancakes. Such doughs or more liquid batters might be combined with baking soda for the production of leavening gas. These sourdoughs may be kept in an imbalanced or unstable state of abnormally high acidity. The other type of sourdoughs are ideally kept in stable-culture states. Breads made from such starters are often associated with places like San Francisco and French sourdoughs, or German-rye sourdoughs, etc. These sourdoughs are leavened by the gas production of yeasts and lactobacilli during fermentation.\nUnstable sourdoughs can easily be created from stable ones, all that's needed is to stop refreshing it as frequently, or to refresh it with a too-high ratio of old:new flour. For both types, sufficient time is required for the organisms to initially grow, and with respect to the latter type, balance themselves into what is called a stable culture. Patience is required for creating both types, and with respect to stable cultures, more attention to details are required.\nRefreshment\nTimelapse of a newly refreshed stiff (100% hydration) rye starter culture over a 10-hour period at roughly 25degC\nRefreshment occurs when new dough is mixed with older dough. New dough is made by mixing fresh flour with water. New dough becomes older dough when it has sufficient age. New dough is essentially new food supply for the yeasts and lactobacilli existing in the older dough. That food supply comes from the flour in the dough.\nWhen older dough is mixed with new dough, any organisms in the older dough inoculate the new dough. With sufficient time the populations of organisms in the older dough increase. Over multiple refreshments, a stable culture emerges. If the objective is maintenance of a stable culture suitable for leavening bread, one which is stored or fermented at room temperatures, refreshments that occur once per day are acceptable.\nTemperature\nAccording to sourdough researcher Michael Ganzle, optimum growth for one strain of Lactobacillus sanfransicensis occurs at 32 degC (89.6 degF), and for the yeast Candida milleri, 27 degC (80.6 degF). That yeast stops growing at 35-37 degC (95-99 degF). Some enthusiasts think that starter-storage temperatures over 27 degC (80.6 degF) are too hot. At temperatures lower than that, the generation times of both organisms are increased.\nAccording to Van der Meulen, Scheirlinck, Van Schoor, et al., when starting a spontaneous starter, enterococci and lactococci establish themselves before lactobacilli, which establish themselves before the yeasts. The emergence of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria follows, and is a marker of having a stable culture. These bacteria produce CO2 leavening gas.\nThus, a tactic to speed the establishment of a stable culture may be to use optimum lactobacilli temperatures in the first 2-3 days, then slightly lower temperatures better suited to yeast growth afterward. Once a stable culture is established, the mother dough is often kept at room temperature, and sometimes is refrigerated to slow growth. Calvel cautioned against the use of storage temperatures lower than 10 degC (50 degF).\npH\nNote:\nThe pH metric (negative log of the concentration of the hydronium ion in an aqueous solution) offers a scale to measure the acidity or alkalinity of liquids. It takes a value between 0.0 and 14.0 and low pH values (tending towards zero) are acidic, 7 is neutral (the pH of pure water), and high pH values (tending towards 14) are alkaline.\nUntil bacteria and yeast populations establish themselves, the pH of the dough tends to be sweeter or more alkaline. The \"sour\" of sourdough essentially means \"acid\" dough. As new dough ages it becomes more acidic due to production of lactic and acetic acids by bacteria growing in the sourdough. Sourdough starter has preservation effects in the bread made with it, decreasing its rate of staling. The pH of a dough can be measured at anytime; however, from a dough kneader's viewpoint, a more acidic dough is stickier.\nIn his correspondence with Dan Wing, Ganzle said the optimum pH for lactobacilli is in the range of 5.0-to-5.5. The lactobacilli colonies stop growing at 3.8, they stop producing acid at 3.6. New dough has a higher pH than sourdough, so every time mother dough is refreshed with new dough, the pH is increased or made more alkaline. As the organisms' populations grow following refreshment, they produce more acid, lowering the dough's pH as time passes. The yeasts are less sensitive to acidic conditions than the lactobacilli, so by manipulating the older:new dough ratio, in cooperation with the time interval between refreshments, conditions more or less favorable for each set of organisms are created.\nTypical ingredients\nunbleached (wholegrain works best) flour\nnon-chlorinated water\nBleached flour or tap water can be used, but may give undesirable results. Bleached flour has most of the yeasts killed. Chlorine in tap water can inhibit the wild yeast that you wish to grow. For typical, artisan-style lean-dough  breads, the wheat flour used should be of a protein level suitable for bread. For quick breads, lower protein flours are commonly desired.\nFlour manufacturers may not have added barley malt or enzymes, thus diastatic malt may be a desired ingredient in the initial dough.  Diastatic malt is generally finely ground malted barley or other sprouted grain that has not been subjected to high temperatures which inactivate its enzymes. One function of the enzymes is to snip apart the starch matrix into food the organisms can consume. If the flour's ingredient label doesn't indicate enzymes or malt were added, then add powdered, diastatic malt at a rate of 0-2% of the flour weight. Calvel used 0.5% based on the flour weight in the initial dough of his primary-culture levain.\nFirm starter by weight\nThe following formula was inspired by the former Larraburu Company of San Francisco.[1] Inspiration was also provided by the works of sourdough researcher Michael Ganzle, as well as many others, found by following the links in the references section. What follows is a simple, basic process, and thus should be beneficial for beginners' understanding. There are many instructions by excellent bakers that use more complexity in their sourdough formulas, often for very good reasons. Unfortunately, those very same embellishments tend to obscure the basic process.\nBakers' percentages\nProfessional bakers measure by weight due to its higher accuracy compared to volumetric measure, even though some professionals publish volumetric recipes. Professional bakers also tend to work with larger dough amounts in commercial settings. One advantage of bakers percentages is that they may be easily scaled to larger or smaller quantities. Baker's percentages are based on flour weight, and are calculated so the flour percentage equals 100%.  However, this is not an article about how to calculate them.\nA brief review of how to use a typical formula composed of bakers' percentages:\ningredient weight = flour weight x baker percent(ingredient)/100%\nSourdough has a flour fraction, as aged as it may be, and it has a water fraction. This means the starter or older dough would need to be proportioned in order that the new flour and the old flour (in the older dough) would add up to 100%. An example of such a notation system is presented by Kulp and Lorenz in their Table 10, \"Formulas of U.S. Sourdough French Bread and Panettone Bread\".[2]\nIn the notation system of Firm starter by weight, the new flour is considered the 100% ingredient. Such a notation system is similar to the one Gisslen used in his formula for Rustic Sourdough Bread, a final dough.[3]  The starter from the prior refreshment and its flour, the old flour, is not included in the 100% new-flour value. Thus, the above formula has been altered with a minor change:\ningredient weight = new-flour weight x baker percent(ingredient)/100%\nScales or balances\nA scale of 1/10 gram readability or better is required for measuring the ingredient weights that follow. The error range of a 1 gram readability scale when measuring 5 grams is 20%.\nIf your scale reads with only 1 gram of accuracy, the weights given will need to be increased. Simply multiply the flour weights by 10 and recalculate the other weights from the bakers' percentages. You could also multiply the given weights by 10.\nInitial dough\nInitial dough1st day\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\ngrams\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n13.33\n\n\nwater\n50%\n6.67\n\n\nformula\n150%\n20\nThe bottom line's numbers are known as the formula percentage and formula weight.\nCombine 13.33 grams of flour with 6.67 grams of water in a rather small bowl, about the size of a custard cup.  Lightly mix it with a spoon until the water has just combined with all or most all of the flour. A second spoon is helpful for scraping the dough from the first spoon. Let it sit or rest for a few minutes to hydrate. Next, finish the mixing process by hand kneading it. It is too small of a dough amount for mixing machines, and it won't need much kneading. If it gets hard to knead, and the dry flour is not fully incorporated, let it rest for 15-20 minutes to relax the dough, then finish kneading it. Form it into a small dough ball. Be sure to have prepared a small jar or container half full of flour, with a slight depression in the center as viewed from above. Place the dough ball into the depression. The purpose of the flour and its depression is to keep the dough ball from rolling and contacting the container and sticking to it: it also raises it higher in the jar, easing daily access. Loosely cover the container with a lid, and ideally store it in a location with a temperature in the range of 27 to 32 degC (81 to 89.6 degF), slightly warmer than room temperature, for about 24 hours. If fermentation occurs at temperatures lower than that, the organisms' generation times are increased.\nMaintain-weight refreshments\nMother doughMaintain weightDays 2-7 (or longer)refresh every 24 hrs\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\ngrams\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n10\n\n\nwater\n50%\n5\n\n\nstarter\n50%\n5\n\n\nformula\n200%\n20\nThe flour weight equals the formula weight divided by the formula percentage: 20 g / 200% = 10 g.\nLightly mix 10 grams of flour with 5 grams of water, making 15 grams of new dough, and let it rest for at least a few minutes to hydrate. Hand knead the result, making a new-dough ball. Weigh 5 grams of starter from the total of 20 grams made the previous day, and discard the remainder. Knead the starter and new-dough ball together well, and form into a refreshed-dough ball. Place it back in the jar, and cover. Repeat this process once per day for at least 7 days. Until you have a stable sourdough and one that rises or swells reliably, continue to ferment it in the range of 27 to 32 degC (81 to 89.6 degF), refreshing once per day. Once your dough rises reliably, fermentation may occur at room temperatures.  If you don't have such a warm place, and only have room temperature available, expect the process to take a bit longer.\nPresuming you originally used a small jar half-filled with new flour, and haven't changed the flour, you will probably observe that it moistens somewhat after a few refreshments, and once a firm sourdough culture is successfully created and fermented in this flour, it will begin to develop its own set of faint odors. It is no longer fresh, new flour.\nYou may decide to change the mother dough's flour weight for various reasons. However, the ratios of the newly added fresh flour to the older flour already fermented are rather important.  This ratio is somewhat occulted in bakers' formula notation, so figure and weigh carefully.\nIncrease-weight refreshments\nMother doughIncrease weight\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\ngrams\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n40\n\n\nwater\n50%\n20\n\n\nstarter\n50%\n20\n\n\nformula\n200%\n80\nTo increase the starter weight the same abstract formula is used to determine the flour weight, but the values used are different. You'll note that in the matrix the 20 g figure occurs on an ingredient line, the starter's line instead of the formula line. To determine the flour weight, the existing starter weight from the prior fermentation is divided by the bakers' percent(starter): 20 g / 50% = 40 g. This is the maximum amount of new flour that can be used for this increase-weight refreshment given the available starter weight.\nThe formula claims you have 20 grams of starter from the prior day. However, weighing it and calculating ingredient weights based on the actual weight is a consideration due to losses, such as dough that sticks to the mixing spoon, or storage container, etc. With a small dough ball, more precision is required.\nIf you use less flour and the prior day's starter weighs 20 g, there will be some starter discard when measuring to the calculated starter weight. If more starter is needed than the formula weight of 80 g, it is best to use only 40 g of flour, let it ferment for 24 hours, then increase it once again.\nPresuming the next step's formula calls for a bakers' percent(starter) of 50%, and presuming you have no dough losses, the table above shows a formula weight of 80 g. Thus 80 g / 50% = 160 g. This means 160 g is the maximum amount of flour to use on the next increase. This increase method maintains the starter:flour ratio and the implied ratio of old:new flour.\nAfter you have increased the mother dough to sufficient weight for your final dough, it is important to weigh and reserve your mother-dough starter before adding the other portion to the final dough, otherwise you will lose your stable culture. In the formula weights calculated above, the starter weight is 5 grams, thus you need 5 grams more starter at the end of increase refreshments than the final-dough formula demands. You may also decide to maintain a different weight mother dough, particularly so your increase weight iterations synchronize better to the final starter weight needed.\nStarter amount for final dough\nThe Larraburu Company is reported to have used a baker's percent value of 15% for the final dough.[1] Let's say you have increased your original 20 g stable-culture sourdough ball to 80 g of starter (because of losses, you'll actually have a little less than that). Remember to reserve 5 g for the mother-dough ball.  80 g - 5 g = 75 g. How much bread can you make? 75 g / 15% = 500 g. This means when you have made 80 g of starter and reserved 5 g for the mother-dough ball, you already have enough starter for a final dough of 500 g new-flour weight. Any other non-flour ingredients in the final dough are irrelevant to that calculation. The formula weight of the final dough will be greater than 500 g.\nAdvanced topics: altering the formula\nOne beauty of baker's percentages is the ease with which an ingredient's values may be changed, thus making a new formula. In the mother dough formulas above, two values that may be changed are the bakers' percent(water) and bakers' percent(starter). The new flour is fixed at 100%.\nLiquid starter\nIf you desire a more liquid starter than the firm starter described above, increase the bakers' percent(water), and recalculate the ingredient weights and formula percent. More liquid starters would generally have a water value of around 100%, though it could be increased further.\nLiquid starter\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n\n\nwater\n100%\n\n\nstarter\n50%\n\n\nformula\n250%\nHowever, by only changing the water value, the old:new flour ratio is also changed.\nWhen fermenting a liquid starter, do not store it in a container filled with flour, just use a container with a suitable opening. A wide-mouthed glass jar with a loose-fitting or breathable lid works well for small amounts. Only fill the container partway full, otherwise the starter may overflow as it ferments.  How much it rises is somewhat dependent on its liquidity and other factors.\nStarter ratio\nThe other value which may be changed is the starter percentage, a value which is related to the old:new flour ratio.  With the water value fixed at 50%, starter values in excess of 100% generally result, just after refreshment, in too low of a dough pH for the lactobacilli to grow well. As that value is increased even further, the lactobacilli will be more inhibited. If you've increased the starter percentage too much, decrease it some, and refresh a few times with the new ratio.\nHigher inoculumliquid starter\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n\n\nwater\n100%\n\n\nstarter\n100%\n\n\nformula\n300%\nWater and starter interrelationships\nThere are interrelationships between the water percentage and the starter percentage that are not quite as obvious. When the starter's percent is a fixed value relative to the new flour, increasing the water percentage decreases the relative amount of flour in a given weight of starter, thus changing the old:new flour ratio.  So, when the bakers' percentage(water) is changed, it will be necessary to adjust the bakers' percentage(starter) to maintain the desired ratio.\nTrue percent\nWhile baker's percentages are based on flour weight, true percentages are based on formula percentage or weight,  frequently phrased as total weight. The formula percent is the sum of the bakers' percentages.\ntrue percent(ingredient)  = baker percent(ingredient)/formula percent x 100%\nThe ratio underlying the true percent is useful for calculating various old:new ratios.\ntrue ratio(ingredient)  = baker percent(ingredient)/formula percent\nIf an ingredient's bakers' percent remains constant, the true percent decreases as formula percent increases, and the true percent increases as formula percent decreases.  When any of the other bakers' percents change, the formula percent changes.\nPuzzle\nConsider the following two formulas:\ningredient\nbakers%\nbakers%\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n100%\n\n\nwater\n50%\n200%\n\n\nstarter\n100%\n200%\n\n\nformula\n250%\n500%\nWhat are the old:new flour ratios?\nHighly-liquid starter by volume\nCombine 1/2 tablespoon of flour with 3 tablespoons of water and let sit overnight at room temperature. Each day add 1 tablespoon of water and one tablespoon flour and mix until the total volume is about 1 cup (240ml). The symbiotic combination of yeasts and lactobacilli can be encouraged to reproduce more easily by controlling the pH (acidity) of the mixture using pineapple juice instead of water for the first three days and maintaining a temperature of 75 degF (about 23 degC, roughly international room temperature). Make sure that you have a working starter by observing whether the dough bubbles and rises. If not, then leave exposed to the air and test again. Thereafter, dump out  1/2 cup (120ml), and mix in  1/2 cup (120ml) water and  1/2 cup (120ml) flour.\nDiscussion\nA method of decreasing the dough's pH faster, one used by The Baker's Manual author Joseph Amendola, is to have an excessively large starter percentage, based on new-flour weight, on the second and third days (first and second refreshment), roughly 214% and 433%, respectively, before dropping it back down to 66.7% on all remaining days of a 7-day-long process.\nWhen making sourdough for the purposes of acid-base leavening, such as pancakes, a more-acid dough is often desired. A simple way for a baker to achieve that using accurate measurement and formula notation is to use an excessively high starter percentage.\nGenerally, sourdough improves with age. There is a noticeable difference between a 1-week and a 1-month starter, and some can tell a difference between 1 month and 1 year. Some will claim it takes 40 years to get a good starter, though nobody waits that long to use it.\nThe sourdough method sometimes takes patience when starting anew. You may have to refresh your dough for longer than 7 days, much depends upon the flour and water used, as well as any yeasts and bacteria that exist in the environment, the starter ratio, the time between refreshments, and the temperature. There is no guarantee that you will pick up good yeasts floating in the air (there are many yeasts, but most will not make for good bread). The only way to tell is to wait until you get a critical mass of yeasts and see if it makes good bread. Generally, bad yeasts will smell strange; and so too will starter that uses too high of a starter:flour ratio, and thus is too acid for the lactobacilli to grow. Your starter should always smell clean, perhaps with undertones of alcohol and a sharp touch of acid if it is getting old.\nThere are other methods that are more likely to succeed, but you may lose the locality effect. Take some organic grapes. Wash them to knock off any dust or dirt, and immerse them in a bowl of potable water for 2 minutes. Remove the grapes from the water, which now contains the yeast that was growing on the outside of the grapes. If the grapes are local, then you have a local starter. Use this water to mix with the flour to make a dough, place in a small cup, cover and wait. If the dough rises, then you have a working starter.\nA third method is to use a little kefir to initiate the sourdough starter. As with grapes, you will not get the effect of using a localised starter, but it is a reliable and effective method. Give it a stir every eight hours or so. It should be very active within 3 hours, possibly as few as 2.\nMixing 100 g flour with 100 g buttermilk or natural yogurt, plus 15 g water is also very effective for beginning a sourdough starter. This usually takes about 72 hours at room temperature to get going.\nOr if you really want to cheat, you can mix flour with water to a desired hydration ratio and add a pinch of shop bought yeast. This should be left for 48 hrs at room temperature before using. You won't get the same natural taste initially, but the local yeasts in the air and in your flour will take over in time.\nKeeping starter\nSourdough starter is alive, and thus it must be regularly refreshed. Exactly how often this should be done depends on storage temperatures and the local strain. An active starter should be fed daily, if not multiple times per day depending on temperature, starter ratio, and other conditions. See the note below about dormant starters.\nSourdough is best stored at room temperature or slightly warmer. Anything outside of this range will change the proportions of the bacteria and yeast, which affects the flavor of the baked product.\nStarter can be safely stored in the fridge, and if so, let it sit out several hours after feeding before returning it to the fridge. This allows the yeasts to get active and feed. Longer than this and your starter will begin to smell boozy and have a sharper tang to it than you might want. To fix this, just discard 90% and start the feeding cycle again.\nAccording to Amendola, starter stored in the refrigerator needs refreshment only once per week. When removed for use, it requires two refreshments at room temperature to recover before adding to a final dough.\nLong-term storage can be done by drying some starter, causing the yeast to go dormant. A thin layer of liquid starter spread on glass or ceramic plate speeds drying. If you have access to a vacuum dryer, that's even better. Exactly how long yeast can be stored this way varies, but it is enough for trading starters.\nFreezing the dried-out starter allows it to be stored for over a year. Just dry the starter out, place it into a sealed jar and put it in the freezer. If you need it again, take one part of frozen starter, crush it, and mix it with one part of fresh flour. Add water and it should get active in a few hours.\nIf you do not bake daily, then your starter will go dormant as the yeasts shut down from hunger. You may see a separation occur in the starter vessel, where a yellowish clear liquid rises to the top and the white doughy starter falls to the bottom.  The liquid is rich in yeast metabolic by-products. You can mix it back in when you feed, but it sharpens the finished bread flavor to a degree that you may find distasteful. Simply throw out the liquid before feeding. But you should note that once your starter has gone dormant, you must re-invigorate by multiple feedings to get it back to a healthful vigor (see below).\nUsing starter\nUsing starter is easy, just take out the amount you need, and then increase the starter to replenish your supply. Avoid using all the starter on hand, though if you must, enough will cling to the sides of the pot to get the starter going again.\nIf using starter often you should keep your batches large enough so that enough is on hand. If you rarely use your starter you should keep just a small amount on hand, and increase it before it's needed.\nYou need to make sure that your starter is full strength before committing it to a dough. That means that it should quadruple if fed and left for an hour. If not, then it needs to be fed. Accelerate your feeding schedule until it passes the above test.\nIncreasing\nMany recipes call for more starter than is kept on hand. Starter is easily increased. At its most basic level, simply add more new dough and let it ferment for a day. However, the amount of new dough added affects the pH, this change in pH in turn affects the culture. If not enough new dough is added, it may not raise the pH sufficiently to insure vigorous lactobacilli growth. If too much new dough is added, the amount of inoculum is reduced, and according to Karel Kulp and Klaus Lorenz, starter values less than 20% of total weight correlate to less stable cultures. In either case, a previously stable culture can become unstable, requiring multiple refreshments and fermentation intervals to restabilize. A formula for increasing starter precisely to a stipulated ratio is covered in the by weight sections.\nReferences\nWikipedia: Sourdough\nWikipedia: Bakers' percentage\n| a b A.M. Galal, J.A.

Buttercreams made with unsalted butter, however, provide a more delicate texture and superior flavor and mouthfeel (texture) to buttercreams made with vegetable shortening."

It is traditionally made with leftover roast meat, but today it is more often made with fresh minced meat.\n\nIngredients\n30 g (1 oz) lard (optional)\n1 lb (450 g) minced or ground lamb or beef\n3 lb (1.3 kg) powdery old potatoes, such as King Edwards\n1 large or 2 small onions\n2 tbsp flour\n2 cups (300 ml) beef stock (alternatively, bouillon cubes can be used, or gravy powder, if the flour is omitted)\nCheese, grated (optional)\n1 handful of mixed vegetables such as sweetcorn or carrots (optional)\nMixed herbs\nMilk\nButter\nProcedure\nHeat oil in a pan and brown the lamb mince. Where lean meat is used, there may be no need to use additional oil.\nFinely chop the onion and lightly fry in a little butter with a small amount of salt until clear.\nAdd the onions to the mince, mixed herbs, and some pepper.\nSprinkle the flour over the mixture, stir, and cook for 3-4 minutes (if using gravy powder, omit this step).\nCover with lamb or beef stock (or add water and beef bouillon/gravy powder) and simmer for 30 minutes.\nTest the savoury mince for seasoning. If gravy is not used, additional salt may be needed.\nMeanwhile:\nPeel, chop and boil the potatoes for 20 minutes until cooked.\nOnce the meat is cooked, skim off the excess fat, then reduce the savoury mince until the liquid is level with the mince and onions.\nDrain the potatoes until completely dry. Mash until smooth and free of any lumps.\nAdd butter to the mashed potato, taste and add seasoning as required.\nSlowly add milk whilst mashing until the mash is soft and creamy (heavy mash will not float properly on top of the mince).\nPut mince mixture in a shallow oven-proof dish.\nLayer the mash over the meat and brush the tops of the potatoes with melted butter.\nIf desired, sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the mash.\nIf cooking without cheese, rough up the surface of the mash by dragging a fork across it, as if ploughing a field.\nBake in a hot oven for about 30-50 minutes until the top is golden brown.\nServe with peas or beans, or other green vegetables.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThe etymology of the name Shepherd's Pie is related to the shepherding of lambs, whereas Cottage Pie was used to describe the dish made with beef--a cheaper meat that was eaten by the poor who lived in cottages. The terms are often used interchangeably, regardless of meat, though most cookbooks will refer to \"shepherd's pie\" if made with lamb, and \"cottage pie\" if made with beef, or highlight the possible variations within a single recipe.\nAdding the butter and milk to the potatoes before they are properly mashed is the best way to make lumpy mash.\nRoughing up the surface of the mash makes the top crispier, by increasing the surface area and providing thin sections which dry out and crisp faster; compare roast potatoes.\nFrying the meat in lard can improve the texture and consistency of the finished product, although this also has the effect of increasing drastically the saturated fat content.\nAs with many dishes based on minced meat, the mince can be cooked for much longer in the stock than specified, up to two hours. Some cooks prefer this as it gives longer for the flavour to develop. People often comment that shepherd's pie tastes better when reheated the day after for this reason! A quicker alternative is to add a splash of Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce or Cookbook:Soy Sauce, both of which act as flavour enhancers.\nFor cottage pie, peas or small chopped carrots are often integrated into the mince during the reduction step.\nSee also\nPate Chinois"

        "text": "Cookbook:Scheiterhaufen (Austrian Bread Pudding)\ndesc\nScheiterhaufen (literally \"funeral pyre\" or \"stake\") is a type of traditional sweet dish in Austria and Southern Germany. It was mentioned for the first time in a Roman cookbook in the 1st century AD by Marcus Gravius Apicius. In 1691 it first appeared in a German cookbook under the name Guldene Schnitten (golden slices). The term Armer Ritter (poor knight) was first used in 1787 and had its breakthrough in the 19th century.\n\nIngredients\n17.5 oz (500 g) stale white bread\n2 apples\n2 peaches\n4 tbsp (60 g) refined sugar\n1 pinch ground cinnamon\n2 cups ( 1/2 L) milk\n4 eggs\n4 tsp (20 ml) rum or a few drops of rum aroma\n1 tbsp butter\nProcedure\nWash the apples and peaches, and peel them if desired. Cut them into slices approximately  1/4 inch (1 cm) thick.\nCut the bread into slices about the same size as the fruit.\nPour the milk into a bowl and add the eggs. Mix well. Then take the slices of bread and let them soak in the mixture for a few seconds. This will take longer if you use stale rather than fresh bread.\nMix the refined sugar and the cinnamon in a cup or a small bowl.\nGrease an ovenproof dish, then layer the slices, bread, and fruit alternately in the dish. Sprinkle a bit of the sugar-cinnamon mixture on top of every layer. For the best result, start and end with a layer of bread. You can decide whether you want an apple and a peach layer or whether you would like to mix the different kinds of fruit.\nScatter a few flakes of butter on top, and put the dish into the oven for 45 minutes at 180degC/350degF.\nEnjoy!\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThis recipe is rather a guideline; you can alter it according to your taste and wishes. Generally, there is not only one recipe for Scheiterhaufen, as people in former times were forced to use what they had available.\nYou can take any kind of white bread you like, stale or fresh. You can use any kind of white bread that you have on-hand, but for an extra soft Scheiterhaufen, something like the white bread used for toast yields the best result. One variation is to roast the bread in a pan with a bit of butter before layering it (in this case you would have to pour the milk-egg-rum mixture on top of your layers).\nYou can use other kinds of fruit to suit your taste, but the traditional Austrian Scheiterhaufen recipe uses only apples. Plums are also a good choice, but frankly, you can use any fruit of the season. The selection above is a summer variation.\nSome cooks like to add nuts like almonds or hazelnuts to create a distinctive taste. You can also add raisins; they are often used together with apples in Austrian cuisine."

Let it marinate for half hour in the fridge while you are cooking the rice.\nBring the fish stock to simmering point without letting the stock boil.

Add the onion and garlic, and sweat very gently as for a soffritto.\nStir in the rice, and cook until it has a transparent look for not more than 2 minutes. Add some salt and pepper and the wine.\nAs the wine cooks away you will see the remaining liquid getting thicker as it is absorbing the starch from the rice. When it is more or less gone, add some hot stock. Do not add too much stock all at once. The rice should never be submerged in stock. Keep stirring it and keep adding more stock as it cooks away. This should take about 15-20 minutes.\nTaste during the cooking to see if the rice is done. The rice should be soft, but have enough bite to it to feel the individual grains of rice.\nFive minutes before the end of the cooking time for the risotto, add the marinated squid, the scallops, and the prawns. Add the parsley right before tuning off the heat.\nWhen it's done, stir in the butter in small chunks at the time, tasting to get the amount of butter right. Season with more salt and pepper to taste.\nLet it rest for a few minutes, and then serve.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nRisotto rice is plump, medium grain rice that contains a lot of starch; Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano varieties are traditionally best."

Also, note that the original recipe didn't call for white wine in the marinade.\n\nIngredients\nKebabs\n1/2 kg large prawns/shrimp, peeled and deveined\n 1/2 kg fish fillets, cut into 2 1/2 cm (1 in) cubes\n 1/2 kg squid, cleaned and cut into 2 1/2 cm (1 in) pieces\nMarinade\n5 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped\n2 bay leaves\n2 jalapenos, seeded and finely chopped\n1 cup (240 ml) lemon juice\n1 tsp ground black pepper\n 3/4 cup (180 ml) extra virgin olive oil\n 3/4 cup (180 ml) dry white wine\nZhoug sauce\n1 cup (240 g) coriander leaves, washed, dried, and chopped\n1 cup (240 g) parsley, washed, dried, and chopped\n1 tsp caraway seeds\n1 tsp cumin seeds\n1 1/2 tsp cardamom seeds\n1 tsp black peppercorns\n1 tsp garam masala\n8 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed\n8 jalapenos, seeded and chopped (adjust the quantity according to your heat tolerance)\n 1/4 cup (60 ml) extra virgin olive oil\nProcedure\nCombine all the marinade ingredients in a nonreactive (glass or ceramic) mixing bowl. Add the seafood and mix to coat well. Refrigerate overnight.\nDry roast the cumin, caraway and cardamom seeds for 2-3 minutes in a cast iron skillet or wok over low heat. Cool, then add the peppercorns and pound in a mortar and pestle to a fine powder.\nIn a blender or food processor, blend the coriander, parsley, spices, garlic, chilli peppers and olive oil together with  1/2 cup water until a thick, smooth paste is formed.\nTransfer the paste into a saucepan, heat until it starts bubbling, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring constantly, until the water is evaporated. Cool, transfer to an airtight container and chill.\nRemove the seafood from the marinade and drain in a colander. Save the marinade for basting the kebabs later. Thread the seafood onto skewers or satay sticks.\nChar-grill the kebabs over hot coals, basting and turning every few minutes. It should take about 10 minutes to cook.\nServe with the zhoug sauce as a dipping sauce."

No cooking is required.\n\nIngredients\n1 large (2.5 kg / 5 lb) fresh cabbage\n2-3 tablespoons non-iodised salt\nProcedure\nClean and dry a large (3 litres) preserves jar or crock, chopping board, and large bowls if needed.\nQuarter the cabbage and remove the core.\nSlice the cabbage finely or thickly, as you prefer.\nIf desired, bruise the sliced cabbage by beating with a rolling pin or mortar and pestle.\nLayer the cabbage in the jar or crock, sprinkling salt in between the layers.\nPack tightly into the jar, leaving 1 cm space at the top; don't seal the jar yet.\nJuice should rise to top of jar as you tightly pack the cabbage in; if not, add a little chlorine-free water.\nCover the jar with a clean cloth or cling-wrap. Set the jar in a bowl or on a plate, so that any juice that might overflow will be collected and won't make a mess. Don't seal the jar while it is fermenting, as it will build up gas pressure and might break the jar.\nEvery morning and evening, insert a narrow long object into the jar to let the air out, then collect the juice from the plate and re-add it to the jar. Ensure the temperature is kept constant during the fermentation--otherwise the fermentation may not proceed correctly, and the wrong bacteria may grow. If you don't heat your kitchen in winter then you will need to store the jar in your bedroom or another area with a steadier temperature throughout day and night.\nThe sauerkraut will be fermented in three days to about a week. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to a cool place (e.g. the refrigerator) to mature. It is ready to eat after the first week, but it will improve with age as the bacteria slowly consume the more complex sugars in the cabbage.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThe salt used should be non-iodised, since iodine can slightly inhibit the fermentation. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the iodine.\nAdd other vegetables, fruits, or spices such as juniper berries, cored and sliced apple, diced pineapple, onion, chili, or grated carrot.\nThe cabbage can be quickly sliced to a regular thickness by using a mandoline.\nSee also\nKimchi"

No cooking is required.\n\nIngredients\nThe ingredients.\n1 kg (2 lb) fresh tomatoes\n1 large capsicum (bell pepper)\n3-6 fresh chiles\n1 fresh red onion\n3-4 cloves of garlic\n1 bunch of fresh cilantro (coriander leaf, Chinese parsley)\n1-2 teaspoons non-iodised salt\nspices to taste (optional)\nProcedure\nClean and dry a large (1 litre) preserves jar and a large bowl\nDice the tomatoes\nQuarter and slice the capsicum\nFinely slice the chilis, removing the seeds if you prefer. Make sure to wash your hands right after cutting the chilis, and DO NOT touch your eyes or face for some time after handling the chilis--if you do, the chili juice residue could cause a very painful burning sensation.)\nPeel and chop the onion and garlic finely. Roughly chop the cilantro.\nMix all ingredients together in the bowl with salt and (optional) spices; mix well!\nPack tightly into the jar, leaving 1 cm space at the top.\nCover the jar with a cloth or cling-wrap. Sit the jar in a bowl or on a plate, so that any juice that might overflow will be collected and won't make a mess. Leave to ferment at room temperature.\nThe salsa will be fermented in 2-3 days, depending on the climate. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to the refrigerator. It will last well in the fridge, but will continue to slowly ferment, getting more sour as time passes.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nWith the above fresh ingredients, there should be enough microbial load for the salsa to start fermenting by itself. Bubbles will begin rising to the top of the jar, showing that fermentation is under way--you should be able to see this through the side of the jar. Don't seal the jar while it is fermenting, as it will build up gas pressure and might break the jar. If you are concerned that fermentation will not start by itself, you can add a starter culture. A good starter culture is a little juice from a recently-fermented sauerkraut or kimchi, as this will bring across the necessary lactic acid bacteria and yeasts.\nThis is best within a few days, unless you like it quite sour!\nThe salt used should be non-iodised salt if possible (e.g. pickling salt, kosher salt). This is because the iodine in iodised table salt will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the iodine.\nUse fresh ingredients where possible; if you do use canned or dried ingredients, you may need to use a starter (see above).\nThis recipe prefers to ferment at a temperature between 18-22degC (64-72degF). It will happily ferment outside that range, but if you want to keep it in that range, there are some tips available on the fermentation page.\nThere is a suggestion on the talk page that more salt is required; read the discussion and decide for yourself, but traditional French recipes add no salt during the fermentation of crushed tomatoes. Salt volume recommendations made without specifying brand (and therefore grain size and shape) are not precise in any case.\nWarnings\nWhen handling hot chilis, use gloves or take extra care to keep your hands away from eyes and other sensitive areas even after washing them."

It is one of the most famous Viennese culinary specialties. The word is sometimes split into Sacher torte.\n\nIngredients\nCake\n6 eggs\n200 g caster sugar\n100 g unsalted butter, soft but not melted\n125 g dark (semi-sweet or bittersweet) eating chocolate, melted\n125 g plain flour\n5 ml vanilla extract\nAssembly\n150 g apricot jam\n150 g (100 ml) golden syrup\n150 g dark eating chocolate (semi-sweet or bittersweet)\nEquipment\nOven\n2 mixing bowls\nWhisk\nKnife\nScales\nMicrowave oven with microwaveable bowl or a saucepan\nRound cake tin (preferably springform with removable bottom) about 20 cm diameter and 10 cm high\nA cup or similar as temporary egg yolk container\nGreaseproof paper\nProcedure\nCake\nPreheat the oven to 170degC.\nSeparate the eggs, putting the whites in a mixing bowl.\nWhisk the whites until fairly stiff and foamy. Add three quarters of the sugar. Whip until fully stiff and foamy, incorporating as much air as possible.\nCream the remaining sugar with the butter and vanilla until pale and creamy.\nGently mix in the egg yolks, then the molten chocolate.\nFold the egg white foam into the batter.\nSift the flour over the batter, carefully avoiding lumps of flour. Mix very gently, folding the ingredients together. Ensure the heavy chocolate does not all end up at the bottom of the bowl.\nLine the cake tin with greaseproof paper, and fill it with the batter.\nBake at 170degC for about 70 minutes.\nAllow to cool in the tin upside down until the cake reaches room temperature (about 30 minutes).\nAssembly\nMicrowave the jam until it melts.\nCut the cake body in half horizontally and place the halves with inner (cut) faces uppermost.\nPour the molten jam onto both halves of the cake, and allow it to soak in.\nReassemble the cake, with cut surfaces together. Allow the surface to cool again.\nMicrowave the golden syrup and chocolate together until the syrup just starts to bubble. Stir until they are smoothly mixed, then cool to about 25degC. This mixture should be spreadable and able to support a thickness of about 2 mm on a vertical surface (test on the wall of the bowl) yet return to shiny soon after being spread. If it is too hard or soft, add more golden syrup or chocolate and go back to the microwaving stage.\nSpread cake body with the glaze. Leave it to set.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThe little bubbles in the egg white foam are what inflate the cake. Do not accidentally get any fat (from the egg yolks, butter, or chocolate) in the egg white mix or it will not foam properly.\nDo not allow flour lumps in the mix, because lumps of white flour show up badly in this brown cake.\nTo get the traditional perfectly cylindrical shape, trim the cake body into a circle with vertical edges, and cut the top off flat before glazing.\nAdding alcohol to the cake is not a good idea. It is already very moist, and more liquid will make it soggy.\nDon't use white chocolate in the cake body because it is fairly unnoticeable in flavour and colour, leaving only the moistening effect.\nDon't use self-raising flour, which creates large bubbles in the cake.\nIf carried out in the order above, no tool should need to be washed up more than once.\nThere are several other recipes for Sachertorte--some use even more eggs in the cake and egg and cream in the glaze.\nReferences\nOriginal Source: Duramecho Sachertorte included here in slightly edited format under GNU General Public License\nThe exact amount of syrup needed in the glaze depends on the sugar content of the chocolate. You want about equal weights of syrup and chocolate for normal UK plain eating chocolate (which is 50% cocoa solids) but more syrup if using darker (e.g. 70%) chocolate."

The stick, which is usually taken from the ground as part of a dead tree branch, does not have to be sterilized, but simply clear of any dirt or bark. Alternately, you may purchase a metal roaster stick. Don't use a coat hanger or chrome or galvanized metal (like fence wire)--use stainless steel.\nBefore roasting the marshmallows, break the crackers in half, so you have two 2 x 2 inch (5 x 5 cm) squares for each s'more. Break the chocolate bar into  1/2 oz (15 g) pieces.\nPush a marshmallow on to the end of the stick. Using the stick to place the marshmallow directly above the flame or source of heat, toast the marshmallow until it is golden brown around the outside. Some prefer their marshmallow burned. Others like to burn the marshmallow and peel off the burned outer skin to get to the gooey center.\nPlace the toasted marshmallow in between two pieces of graham cracker, with a layer of chocolate bar in between. The marshmallow should be hot enough to melt the chocolate. In a family setting, sometimes it is helpful for children to roast the marshmallows, and adults to supervise and assemble the s'more while preventing the child from touching the hot end of the stick. Enjoy!\nIndoors\nPrepare the pieces of graham cracker and chocolate as above.\nPlace the chocolate on one of the pieces of graham cracker, and then place a marshmallow on top.\nPut it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds (depending on the microwave).\nAfter it has been microwaved, the marshmallow should be much bigger, fluffier, and molten, and the chocolate should be semi-melted. Place the other half of the graham cracker on top of the marshmallow and squish it down.\nVariations\n70 variations on the basic s'more recipe were published in 2007 in S'mores: Gourmet Treats for Every Occasion by Lisa Adams. If you are not camping, patio/backyard firepits work great.\nThe patriot\nMilk chocolate\n1 graham cracker, broken in half\nFresh blueberries\n1 marshmallow\n1 thick strawberry slice\nArrange the chocolate on half of the graham cracker. Set blueberries atop chocolate and melt, being careful not to lose the blueberries in transport. Roast the marshmallow. Once chocolate has melted, remove graham cracker from heat and lightly press blueberries to secure them in place. Top with the strawberry slice, roasted marshmallow, and remaining graham cracker.\nMinty brownie\n1 marshmallow\nA handful of Junior Mints candies\n2 brownie squares\nRoast the marshmallow. If desired, melt chocolates on the brownie bottom. Once the chocolates have melted, remove brownie from heat. Add roasted marshmallow and top with remaining brownie square.\nCaramel apple\n1 marshmallow\n2 chewy caramel candies\n2 green apple slices, about  1/2 inch thick\nSkewer the marshmallow, then the two caramels, on the same roasting stick. Roast the marshmallow and caramels. When the caramels have melted over the top of the marshmallow, and the marshmallow is cooked to your liking, slide the concoction onto one of the apple slices. Top with remaining apple slice.\nBelgian s'more\n1 set of s'more ingredients (can be any recipe, but usually the standard one)\n2 red and/or black licorice strips\nPrepare the s'mores as usual, then at the end insert either a strip of red or black licorice (or both.)"

        "text": "Cookbook:Traditional Pilau Rice\ndesc\nKnown as pilau, pullao, pulao and pilaf, this rice dish will take between up to an hour to prepare if made the traditional way. The cooking time can be reduced with various ingredient compromises, like using ready-fried onions instead of caramelizing the onion yourself, and using quorn mince rather than taking the time to brown lamb mince. Many Indians are vegetarian, and meat is not necessary for this dish; omitting the mince and just using chickpeas for the protein, or substituting imitation ground meat will make the recipe vegan or vegetarian.\n\nIngredients\n425 ml basmati rice\n1 medium onion or  1/2 large onion, peeled and finely chopped\n1-2 cloves of garlic\nGaram masala spice mixture\n1 tsp ground cumin\n1 1/2 tsp ground coriander\n250 g minced meat (lamb or mutton are most common, but you could use beef or imitation meat).\n400 g tinned chickpeas (240 g drained weight)\n1 large tomato, diced, or 1 dozen cherry tomatoes, cut into eighths\nFrozen petits pois (optional)\nSalt\nOil (use sunflower oil or a similar vegetable oil without a strong taste) or ghee\n575 ml water\nProcedure\nWash the rice in several changes of water and leave it to soak while you prepare the other ingredients, changing the water whenever you have a spare moment.\nChop the onion, and heat the oil or ghee in the saucepan. Add the onion to the pan and fry over a very low heat until caramelized, stirring frequently to prevent them burning. The onions must be browned, not translucent, to get the authentic flavour. This will take at least 15 minutes. If you want to save time, you can do as many Pakistani cooks do and use the ready-fried onions that can be bought in large bags in Asian supermarkets (or in small, expensive pots sold as \"crispy salad onions\" in English supermarkets). If using ready-fried onions, skip this step and add them when you add the water.\nWhile the onions are browning, prepare the other ingredients (not forgetting to stir the onions occasionally). Bash the garlic in a mortar and pestle with some salt, chop the tomatoes and drain the chickpeas.\nWhen the onions look like they are beginning to brown, add the garlic and any powdered or seed spices. Do not add them earlier than this or they will burn in the long time the onions take to caramelize.\nWhen the onions and garlic are both done, add the tomatoes and stir for a minute or so. This will help to deglaze the pan and seems to stop the onions cooking any more. Turn up the heat and add the mince. If using meat mince, cook until completely browned (5-10 minutes). If using quorn mince, you just need to cook for a couple of minutes until heated through.\nWhile the mince is cooking, drain the washed rice in a sieve and put a kettle of water on to boil. When the mince is cooked, add the drained rice to the pan, along with a little extra oil or ghee if necessary. Stir the rice gently until it is coated in the oil, taking care not to break up the grains.\nAdd 575 ml hot water, along with the drained chickpeas and any larger spices like bay leaves, cardamom pods or cloves. Add the salt and bring to the boil.\nOnce boiled, put on a tight-fitting lid and turn the heat to very low. Cook for 25 minutes and do not remove the lid.\nAfter 25 minutes, remove the lid, add the peas, cover with a clean teatowel (optional) and replace the lid. Turn off the heat and leave to rest for 5 minutes; the peas will cook in the residual heat and the teatowel will absorb excess moisture/condensation.\nTurn out onto a serving platter (separate large lumps by pressing with the back of a spoon) or plate up. Add any garnishes, and serve with yoghurt.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nBasmati rice will produce the best flavour, but other long-grain rice can be used.\nA cast iron pan with a thick bottom will reduce the likelihood of the rice burning at the bottom. The saucepan you use should have a minimum of 20-22 cm diameter.\nWhether to serve this dish as a meal in itself or a side dish depends on the ingredients used. If you have used ingredients containing protein, like mince or chickpeas, it can be served as a meal in itself with perhaps just a side salad. If you omit most of the ingredients, it can serve as a plainer foil to a spicy dish.\nChopped chillies may be added and the frying stage, but if you are going to be eating the rice with curry you may prefer it plain.\nDried chickpeas are cheaper than tinned chickpeas but much less convenient--they must be soaked overnight and then cooked for a long time separately to the rice.\nOther ingredients, such as cubed potatoes (1-2 cm to a side), diced carrots or courgettes (zucchini) cut into matchsticks can be added when the water is added. Ingredients like diced mushrooms or cubes of aubergine (eggplant) (1-2 cm to a side) can be added at the frying stage.\nSliced reconstituted dried mushrooms are a non-traditional but tasty variant that can be added either during the frying stage or when the water is added. Use 6-8 dried mushrooms, remembering that their size will increase greatly when soaked. Large bags of shiitake-like dried mushrooms can be bought cheaply in Chinese supermarkets, and the soaking liquid from the mushrooms can be substituted for some of the water to give the rice a really rich, tasty flavour without using any meat (just make sure to either strain the liquid through cheesecloth or leave the last centimetre or so of liquid in the jug to avoid getting any grit that has been washed off the mushrooms in your rice).\nThe rice can be garnished with toasted flaked almonds when it is turned out onto a plate.\nPlease note that the amounts of rice needed is given by volume, not weight.\nThe rice should be well washed. Skipping the washing step will cause the rice to gum together because of the starch.\nBe careful to use the right proportions of water. If you use too much, the rice will be soggy, and if you use too little it may be hard in the middle. The rice should have absorbed all the water by the end of the cooking time; if you have to drain water off, you have used too much. If you are using a lot of wet ingredients, you may need to reduce the quantity of water used very slightly.\nDifferent rice varieties require different amounts of water, so if you wanted to make this recipe using brown rice instead of white basmati rice, you would need to change the amount of water.\nIf you are not using mince, you need less spices, and if you are using mince, you need more spices.\nQuorn mince can be cooked from frozen but meat mince must be defrosted.\nThe spice mixture can be bought pre-mixed from Asian supermarkets or you can make your own using cumin, coriander powder, powdered ginger, turmeric, nutmeg, cardamom, fennel seeds, pepper, cloves, bay leaves etc. At least a teaspoon of cumin and coriander is essential, but you can pick and choose which of the others you want to include, or use just a pinch or two of each of them.\nWarnings\nDo not store the cooked rice at room temperature--this can cause food poisoning."

        "text": "Cookbook:Traditional Finnish Lemon Mead (Sima)\ndesc\nSima is a Finnish, lemon-flavored mead mostly consumed during the celebrations of the 1st of May. A glass of sima is traditionally accompanied by a funnel cake or sugar coated donut.\n\nIngredients\n8 litres water\n500 g brown sugar\n500 g white sugar\n2-3 lemons\n 1/4 tsp yeast (ordinary baker's yeast, either fresh or dry)\n1 handful of raisins\nEquipment\nContainer large enough to hold all of the sima (a big plastic bucket for example)\nEmpty bottles\nFunnel\nProcedure\nFirst day\nSterilize all of your equipment. A thorough process is described in the mead recipe. However, as the fermentation time of sima is very short (only a few days) and it is usually consumed within a week or so, just washing the bucket and bottles well and then rinsing them with boiling water right before using is generally enough to prevent spoiling.\nBoil 4 litres of water.\nWash the lemons well and peel the zest, being careful not to include the bitter white pith. Put the zest into your container.\nSlice the lemons and remove the white pith from around the slices. Add the slices into the container.\nAdd all the sugar into the container with the lemons.\nPour the boiling water on top, and mix well until the sugar is mostly dissolved.\nAdd 4 litres of cold water so that the mixture will be lukewarm, the right temperature for the yeast to activate. If unsure, check with a thermometer--the temperature should be between 35degC and 45degC.\nWhen the temperature is right, add the yeast. One way is to take a small cup of the mixture from the container, dissolve the yeast in it and then mix it back. Just dropping a crumb of fresh yeast into the container will also work.\nLet it stand overnight in room temperature.\nSecond day\nBottle it on the next day: add one spoonful of sugar and a few raisins to each bottle before you pour the sima in.\nAfter bottling, let the bottles stand at room temperature out of direct sunlight for 2 more days. The raisins will bloat up and float to the surface.\nMove the bottles to your refrigerator. The sima is ready, and should be served cold. It will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator.\nNotes, tips and variations\nFor a simpler process, just squeeze in the juice of 1-2 lemons instead of removing the pith.\nYou may use 1 kg brown sugar instead of mixing white and brown to make a darker sima with a stronger brown sugar flavour.\nAll the sugar may optionally be replaced with 1 kg honey.\nYou can put the bottled sima into the refrigerator immediately instead of fermenting overnight at room temperature. This will cause the fermentation to be slower; the sima will be ready in approximately 5-7 days.\nPlastic soda bottles are recommended as pressure can build up in the bottles. An exploding plastic bottle is less dangerous than an exploding glass bottle.\nReferences\n| \"Annatko lastesi juoda simaa? - \"Hyva tiedostaa juoman alkoholipitoisuus\"\".

        "text": "Cookbook:Tonkotsu Ramen\ndesc\nTonkotsu ramen is a dish of ramen noodles served in rich and fatty pork broth usually garnished with a variation of toppings (most of the time pork cutlets, green onions, and hard-boiled eggs split in two). There are many variations to this recipe. Some people add some chicken bones or beef bones to create a unique combination of flavors. A lot of the ingredients aren't available in just any grocery stores, but you shouldn't have a lot of trouble finding them at the Asian grocers in your local international district. You would be surprised on how much better tasting it is than the store bought instant ramen brands.\n\nIngredients\nMarinated eggs\n12 eggs in shells\n1 lb diced pork hock meat\n3 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces\n1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, sliced\n2 large cloves of garlic, sliced\n 1/2 cup soy sauce\n2 tbsp cooking wine/sake/sherry\n2 tbsp sugar\n 1/2 cup water\nSoup\n6 pork hock bones\n3 green onion\n1 Fuji apple\n2 medium-sized yellow onions\n1 1/2 tbsp fresh grated ginger or 2 tsp prepackaged ginger paste\n3 cloves of garlic, quartered\n2 tbsp sesame oil\n12-16 cups water\nNoodles\n500 grams all-purpose flour or medium-strength flour\n5 grams powdered kansui (see notes)\n200 ml water\nPotato or corn starch\nChashu\n500 grams side pork\n50 ml soy sauce\n50 ml mirin\n1 tbsp sugar\n500 ml water\nProcedure\nMarinated eggs\nBring a pot of water to a rolling boil. If desired, use a small thumb tack to prick a pin hole in the base of every egg, then add eggs to the pot. The water should cover the eggs.\nWait for the water to come back to a full boil, then cook for 7-9 minutes. 9 minutes will give you a fully hard boiled egg, while 7 minutes makes a jammier egg.\nDrain the pot and eggs and plunge the eggs in ice water to stop the cooking. This also makes the shells a bit easier to peel.\nIn a small pot, saute pork, garlic, onions, and ginger until slightly browned. Add soy sauce, cooking alcohol, sugar, and water, and simmer for 10 minutes until pork is cooked through and flavors meld. Remove from stove.\nRemove pork to eat separately. Pour everything else into a bowl large enough to hold marinade and eggs. Carefully, peel the eggs, and place in marinade. Try to make sure the marinade covers all of the eggs. If not, try transferring the sauce into a large ziplock bag, and place the eggs in the bag and seal.\nPlace the bag in a bowl, and put everything in the refrigerator overnight or at least for a few hours.\nSoup\nUsing a butcher knife, separate off the pork hock bones.\nRinse well in running water to wash off the blood. Boil in large pot for 15 minutes and make sure you barely cover the bones with the water.\nSkim off as much scum/foam as much possible as it forms.\nDrain in colander and use a brush to remove any bloody meat.\nUse a saw and cut halfway down the center of the bones. Then use hammer to break bone.\nThe bones will be filled with marrow. Simmer for several hours until the marrow dissolves out from the bones.\nScum will form at the start. Carefully skim the scum off. Maintain a low boil over medium heat.\nAfter scum has stopped forming, simmer for 6 hours or more. Add more water if the water level drops.\n2 hours after the pork bones have started simmering, the soup should become progressively white and cloudy. If tasted at this stage, the soup will not taste good since it will still have a raw flavor.\nAfter the soup has simmered for 6 hours, the inside of the bones should be empty and the soup should have a rich smell just like a ramen place.\nChashu\nBrown the meat in a pan and then simmer in a pot for 2 hours in a sauce made from the remaining ingredients. Allow to cool in the pot. The char siu should be a nice amber color. Slice with care since it will be very tender and tend to fall apart.\nNoodles\nMix the flour and kansui together, then add the water. It may feel as if the amount of water is insufficient--this is normal.\nMix in bowl until a mealy consistency is achieved. The dough will be very stiff. Use you body weight to form the dough into a ball.\nTransfer to kneading surface and knead. Knead vigorously for 10 minutes. It is okay if the dough cracks or does not knead together well.\nForm into ball, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Make sure that the dough does not dry out.\nAfter the dough has rested, roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5 mm and then insert into pasta machine. Start out with the highest thickness and then continue on the lower settings until the desired thickness is achieved. If a pasta machine is not used, roll out the dough to the desired thickness with the rolling pin. Take into account that the noodles will expand 1.3 times when boiled.\nThe dough will not be that sticky, so a small amount of flour or potato (or corn) starch is sufficient for flouring.\nA wooden box is best for storing the noodles, but if one is not available, use a metal tray lined with wax paper (to prevent sticking) and store in the refrigerator.\nAssembly\nBring a pot of water to a boil, and add the noodles. Cook the noodles to each person's preference, then drain. For people who like curly noodles, firmly squeeze the noodles until the desired effect is achieved.\nWarm a large soup bowl, and add the drained noodles. Add broth, then top with char siu and marinated egg. Add salt for flavor--use sparingly at first and then add more if desired.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nKansui is a Japanese mixture of alkaline salts. Try the Koon Chun brand, which comes in a clear glass bottle labeled \"potassium carbonate & sodium bi-carbonate solution\". The UPC is 0-20717-80230-8.\nAny leftover char siu can be eaten with beer. If you ever have trouble slicing soft pork, chill the whole piece in the refrigerator until cold, and it makes slicing easier. Reheating is easy, in either the microwave or oven, even stove top.\nMake sure you keep up on scooping out the foamy gunk from the broth--you don't want all that stuff all over your ramen.\nDon't be afraid to experiment with different types and balances of garnishes!"

Ground beef will need to be broken up as it cooks; chopped or sliced beef needs to be stir-fried and may require oil. When using high-fat ground beef, you may wish to drain and very, very lightly rinse the beef in a colander, or add water to float the fat, cool to solidify the fat, remove the fat, drain the water, and reheat. If you are using ground beef, which is quite alright, also see the Taco Meat recipe.\nAdd lots of cumin to the beef. Cumin is the magic ingredient that makes a taco taste like a taco. You may also add a bit of salt, a bit of chili powder and/or diced onion.\nPrepare the outside covering:\nPre-made shells can be reheated in the microwave as the package directs.\nPlain corn tortillas can be used for soft tacos, although, for soft tacos, either a double layer of corn tortillas or a single layer of flour tortilla works best. The tortillas should be microwaved, covered, in 15+ second stages, flipping between stages, until warm, and kept covered and warm prior to use.\nYou could make your own hard taco shells from corn tortillas, but rest very well assured that soft corn tortilla tacos are absolutely the most traditional.  If you need hard shells and can not find them pre-made, you may, with great effort and use of your time, use a deep-fat process, going one at a time and using a large spoon to form the shells into the normal U shape. Pan frying in  1/4 inch to  1/2 inch of oil will also work; be sure not to let the tortillas stiffen prior to being bent into the U shape you desire.\nPlace hot beef into a hard shell or down the middle of a warm soft tortilla (two for corn). A very simple, and quite authentic, taco would be to then add a sprinkling of finely diced onion and cilantro into the inside of the taco, fold the tortilla over (if soft) and serve with lime quarters for squeezing into the taco. See Tacos de Bistec.\nYou may also continue on to place cheese onto the beef. The heat of the beef should slightly melt the cheese. You may wish to microwave the taco a bit, especially if the cheese is cold or if you are using low-fat cheese.\nAdd other toppings as the cook desires.\nServe the tacos with a small or large assortment of items that people can add. Traditionally, in a restaurant, this would amount to only pico de gallo or a hot sauce. However, 'build-your-own' tacos with a good assortment of items to add can add a bit of fun to a gathering or family dinner."

Many variations of recipe exist, however they generally include liberal quantities of boiled Tatties (potatoes) and salt. \n\nIngredients\n1 kg floury potatoes (e.g. Yukon gold)\nButter\nSalt and pepper\nFlour\nProcedure\nCook potatoes in salted boiling water until tender, drain them well and put them back into the hot pot to dry them out a bit.\nMash them well with lots of butter and salt and pepper, but no milk or other liquid. Let them cool.\nWhen the potatoes are cold, stir in flour and a little more melted butter to make a smooth dough. Roll out to a thickness of about 5 mm, and cut into 3-inch (7.5 cm) wedges.\nCook in a lightly-buttered frying pan until golden, about 1-2 minutes a side.\nServe the potato scones right away with cold butter to spread on top, or store them in the fridge until you want to use them, reheating them in a well-buttered frying pan.\nSome people are content to eat them cold with butter, or heat them in a toaster for buttering. They also freeze very, very well."

There should be enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan when you swirl it.\nAdd the onion, and fry until soft and translucent. Add in the garlic at around this time to soften up as well. Stir in the sliced parsnip and carrots using your spatula. Once all the vegetables are nice and soft, pour them into the casserole dish.\nAdd some more olive oil to your now empty frying pan, and bring it up to a medium-high heat (think about 70-80% of max).

Give it a stir with your spoon. Finely chop a reasonable amount of the herbs, add them into the casserole dish, and give it all another stir. Add some black pepper and a pinch of salt, then cover with the lid.\nBake in the oven at about 180degC for about an hour. After that, check it, give it a stir and check to see if the venison is cooked through. If it isn't, put it back in the oven for longer, checking every 10 mins or so. Once you're happy it's cooked, remove the lid from the casserole dish.\nMake sure the puff pastry is rolled out about as thick as a PS1 or 1 euro coin. Drape the puff pastry over the dish, covering your cooked pie innards. Trim the excess pastry off with a knife, and make some pretty decoration on the top of the pie if you want to. Make sure to pierce the pastry in 2 or 3 places to allow steam to escape.\nBrush the pastry with milk. Turn the oven up to 200degC then put the pie back in for a further 20 minutes, or until the pastry has risen and turned a golden brown.\nServe."

Keep adding water and stirring until you've almost reached the rim of the bowl. Don't let it spill over. Let the paste mixture rest in the bowl for 1.5 hours to allow the mixture to settle.\nSaute the small onion in 3 tbsp oil until golden brown.\nIn a stockpot, combine the cooked onion and pig feet with 2 L water. Slowly bring it to the boil over medium heat.\nAdd lemongrass, then slowly and carefully pour in the shrimp paste mixture, making sure to only add the clear liquid and not the silt that has settled at the bottom of the bowl.\nTo the residual shrimp paste, add another litre of water and stir. Again, wait until the mixture has settled before adding it into the stockpot.\nSimmer the stock for 20 minutes.\nAdd the beef and occasionally skim the broth to ensure you get a nice clear liquid. Cook for another 20 minutes, checking the beef to be sure it's not overcooked.\nAdd fish sauce and sugar to taste to achieve a nice balance between salty and sweet.\nWhile the broth is cooking, heat some oil in a pan and add the red pigment. Cook until the pigment is blended with the oil. Add to the stock. Repeat the process with the chilli powder.\nAssembly\nCombine chopped parsley and cilantro leaves with the uncooked medium onion.\nIf you are using fresh noodles, simply add boiling water to heat them up. If you're using dried noodles, soak them in boiling water until they are soft then dip in cold water to stop the cooking process. Do not over cook them or you'll have mush. Dried noodles have already been cooked.\nIn a large soup bowl, place a handful of noodles, top with a handful of the parsley/cilantro/onion mixture, and ladle on generous amounts of steaming hot broth, ensuring there are several pieces of beef and pork.\nServe hot with the condiments. You can add a squeeze of lime and chopped fresh chillies if you like your food extra spicy. It is also common to add a small dollop of shrimp paste to the soup, but those unfamiliar with the taste may not like it.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nRice noodles about the size of spaghetti No 5. are preferred.\nShrimp paste is essential to this dish, and this cannot be considered bun bo hue without it. Different types of shrimp paste can be found all over Vietnam. Some are of better quality than others. Some purists believe that only Hue shrimp paste is acceptable for this dish as it is smoother and of superior quality than other pastes, which can have trace amounts of sand in them. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find outside of Vietnam, so an \"inferior\" paste may be substituted."

The ideal is to have the sauce with little separate liquid when it is served, but not dry enough to scorch. It may be simmered on top of the stove, or in a very low oven, or in a slow cooker. The sauce is edible after about 40 minutes but is infinitely better flavoured and textured after 3 or 4 hours. In a slow cooker it can be cooked for 8 hours. The flavour is even better if it is cooked, allowed to cool overnight, and reheated for 30 or 40 minutes--but, this is a council of perfection and not really necessary.\nAbout 30-40 minutes before serving remove the bay leaves, add the herbes de Provence, and adjust the salt (i.e. taste it and add more salt if you think it needs it).\nJust before serving, add freshly-ground black pepper.\nServe over al dente pasta sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese."

Add yeast and let stand until sponge/foamy.\nPlace remaining  1/2 cup brown sugar, 4 cups flour, and salt in large mixing bowl, then briefly mix.\nMix the dough:\nIf using stand mixer: using dough hook on low speed, add yeast mixture, oil, and warm milk, and mix for 2 minutes. Stop and scrape bowl if necessary. Continuing on low speed, add remaining flour,  1/2 cup at a time, until dough clings to hook and cleans sides of bowl. Continue to on low speed to knead the dough at least 2 minutes. The coarseness of the bran may prevent the dough from forming a ball on the hook, but so long as the hook is getting contact with the dough kneading will be accomplished. Be cautious adding the flour--never more than 6 cups--as the bread may become very dry.\nIf working by hand: add yeast mixture, oil, and warm milk, working with a spoon at first and then with clean hands. Dough will be difficult to get to mix in all the flour, but you can do it! Turn onto a floured surface where you can work in additional flour, adding about  1/4 cup at a time and working completely in before adding more. Knead until firm.\nPlace dough in a greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover, and let rise in warm place free of drafts for about 1 hour, until doubled in size.\nPunch down and divide in half. Shape into a loaf and place in greased loaf pan. Cover, let rise in warm place free of drafts about another hour, until doubled in size.\nBake in an oven at 400degF (200 degC) for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350degF (175degC) and bake for another 30 minutes or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.\nRemove immediately from pans and cool on wire racks.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nThe 100% whole wheat will not knead to a silken smooth dough. Kneading will often work some of the coarser bran out of the dough, depending on the type of flour you have on hand. The finer the milling, and the higher gluten, the better the whole-wheat bread.\nVariation - Whole wheat rolls\nAdd 1-2 Tablespoons brown sugar, and increase the yeast to 3 packages. Raise for about 15 minutes, then divide for rolls, below, and raise in warm oven (90degF / 30degC) for 15 minutes. Bake at 425degF (220degC) for 12, or until lightly tanned. For spiral rolls: divide in half, roll to 12x9-inch (30x20 cm) rectangle. Cut into 10-12 equal-width strips, and roll each strip tightly. For clover leaves: divide dough into 24 equal portions. Form each piece into a ball and place in greased muffin pan. With scissors, cut each ball in half, then quarters. Place on greased baking sheets about 2 inches (5 cm) apart."

        "text": "Cookbook:White Sauce\ndesc\nWhite sauce is a common name (chiefly in the US and Britain) for the classic Bechamel Sauce, one of the \"Mother Sauces\" of French Cuisine. In French cooking, Bechamel Sauce is rarely used on its own; it is more often used as the base for derivitave sauces or as a binder for gratinees. Bechamel's American cousin, on the other hand, is frequently used as a finished product. White sauce is generally more highly seasoned than is Bechamel, but the procedure for making both is the same.\n\nIngredients\n1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter\n 1/4 cup (60 g) all-purpose flour\n2 cups (480 ml) whole milk\n 3/4 tsp onion salt\n 1/4 tsp ground white pepper\n1 tsp ground mustard seed\n1 pinch fresh-ground nutmeg\n1 bay leaf\nProcedure\nMake a white roux: melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat until the foam subsides. Add the flour and whisk together, still over the heat, for 2-3 minutes. The flour should lose its raw smell but should not brown.\nAdd the milk to the roux while whisking quickly but smoothly to create a smooth mixture.\nAdd the seasonings and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Simmer the sauce until it lightly coats the back of a spoon.\nRemove the bay leaf, taste and adjust for salt and pepper, and serve.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nA sweet white sauce can be made by replacing the seasoning items with sugar (preferably caster). Adding rum or brandy to taste will make this the sweet sauce traditionally served with Christmas pudding.\nThe seasonings can be adjusted according to individual taste and the intended use: some dishes will require a more highly seasoned sauce, others a milder concoction.\nThe flavor can also be altered by adding various herbs (parsley, celery leaves, thyme, etc.) along with the other seasonings. Generally, additions should be strained from the sauce prior to use--straining would not apply, for instance, to traditional parsley sauce, typically served with fish, in which the green of the herb is an integral ingredient. Keep in mind that the sauce should be mildly flavored and that any additions should complement the finished dish, not overpower it.\nWhite sauce can be made ahead-of-time: remove from the heat and press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the sauce to prevent it from forming a skin. Reheat over a low flame, stirring constantly, until it barely simmers.\nIn the event that lumps have formed in your sauce, simply pour through a medium strainer before serving."

In this case, this will be enough for about two people.\nMore traditional recipes call for much less marinating. In fact, some will marinate it for as little as 10 minutes total (basically just the time it takes to get the sides ready). If marinating for a small amount of time be aware that the acidity of the lime is the only thing that \"cooks\" the fish."

If using a mixer with various kinds of beaters, use the whisk attachment. This step is very important, because the cream will not rise if the mixer is warm.\nIn the chilled bowl, whip heavy cream until soft peaks form. Do not over-beat, as this will yield butter.\nNotes, tips, and variations\nYou must use a grade of cream with a fat content of at least 30%, since the fat is what stabilizes the whipped cream.\nUnlike when whipping egg whites, it's not important to make sure there's no fat in the mixture (after all, the cream itself is high in fat). It is important, however, to make sure that the bowl and mixers are dry and cold and that the cream is cold.\nTo sweeten the cream, about 2 tablespoons of sugar per cup (0.25 L) of heavy cream are appropriate."
