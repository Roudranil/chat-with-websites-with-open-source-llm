        "desc": "Switchel, also known as ginger water or haymaker's punch, is a sweetened beverage made from ground ginger, apple cider vinegar, sugar or other sweeteners and water.  It is a traditional drink on farms in the north eastern United States, where it was made to soothe the thirsts of farm workers as well as (allegedly) boost one's stamina. It is served chilled, but is often served warmed in the Winter months.\n",

        "desc": "Sweet cornbread is a variant of the Skillet Cornbread made throughout central and eastern Ontario and Quebec and is sometimes known by the alternative name of Johnny Cake.[1] Its presence in these southern regions of Canada is thought to be due to the influx of British Loyalists from what is now the Southern United States moving to the then-English-controlled colonies during the American War of Independence.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1 cup (140 g / 4.9 oz) cornmeal\n2 cups (275 g / 9.7 oz) all-purpose flour\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n 1/2 cup (160 g / 5.6 oz) maple syrup\n 1/2 cup (90 g / 3.2 oz) brown sugar\n 1/2 cup (125 g / 4.4 oz) butter, softened\n1 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs",
        "Procedure": "In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the butter. Soften the butter beforehand if you must by heating it a little.\nThe butter/egg mixture should be loose. Add the sugar and maple syrup, mix well, then add the salt to the liquid mixture.\nMix the cornmeal and baking powder, then blend them into the liquids.\nSlowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper cake batter texture. This should be softer than a cookie dough, able to stick to the mixing spoon and come off in blobs. You may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.\nPour into a greased pan, put into an oven heated to 200degC (400degF), and let bake for between 15-25 minutes.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "When mixing the batter, be sure it is soft enough for a typical cake; you do not want it too moist or dry. Use milk to fill in liquid you need and a half-and-half mix of flour and cornmeal if you are too moist.\nKeep a close eye on the cake while it bakes: it will become hard fast if you do not take it out in time.\nIf you want to make a crisper crust take a 3 part mix of equal volumes of flour, cornmeal and brown sugar, mix well. Add to the top of the cake half way into the baking process, but do this very quickly: leaving the door open too long will make your cake a rock.  The amount required varies based on the pan you use, so use your eyes for what you need (less than a cup total).  Despite the call for opening it halfway through baking, adding it at the beginning should work fine as well.\nYou can substitute honey for the maple syrup, or plain sugar. Maple is used for its flavouring as much as its sweetness.\nMargarine or vegetable oil will do as well as butter for this. Butter was used traditionally and is thus listed.\nThis dish is usually made for after meals and outside them rather than with them, which is how its cousin  Skillet Cornbread is used.  However, when having  Maple Beans and Ham, Sweet Cornbread is often served with it.",

        "desc": "Sushi rice, termed sushi meshi or shari in Japanese, is a key ingredient for sushi and a staple of Japanese cooking. It consists of short-grain rice dressed with seasoned vinegar called sushisu. The rice is then cooled and dried for easy manipulation and to give a glistening appearance. The Japanese measure their uncooked rice using a measurement called a Go. This is roughly equivalent to 150 grams when used to measure Japanese rice. One Go is also the standard size of a rice cooker's measuring cup.\n",
        "Ingredients": "Rice\n2 go (300 g) uncooked, washed, short-grain Japanese rice\n400 ml water\n1 small sheet of kombu (optional)\n1 metric tablespoon (15 ml) sake (optional)\nSushisu\n3 metric tablespoons (45 ml) of rice vinegar\n1-2 metric tablespoons (12-24 g) of sugar (depending on how sweet you prefer it)\n1-1.5 metric teaspoons of sea salt",
        "Equipment": "Rice cooker\nHangiri (rice barrel; optional)\nShamoji (rice paddle; optional)\nFukin (cloth; optional)\nSensu (fan; optional)",
        "Procedure": "About 30 minutes before starting, fill the hangiri with water and let it stand. The water saturates the wood, which prevents the rice from sticking to it.\nMake the sushisu: Mix the vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat the mixture in a saucepan until everything is dissolved, but do not boil. Set aside to cool.\nRinse the rice. Put the rice in the cooking pot, half filled with cold water, and swirl it around with your hand. The water will turn chalky white. Carefully drain off the water, and repeat the process several times, until the water remains clear.\nAllow the rice to stand for 30 minutes. Some recipes say the rice should remain in the cooking pot submerged in its cooking water; others say to transfer it temporarily to a colander to drain.\nAdd an 8 cm-sized sheet of kombu to the cooking pot, along with the sake if you are using it.\nBoil the water in the cooking pot.\nRemove the kombu from the cooking pot just as the water boils, and reduce the heat. Simmer the water and rice in the cooking pot for 20 minutes.\nTurn off the heat but do not remove cover from the cooking pot for 10 minutes (no peeking).\nTransfer the rice from the cooking pot to the hangiri; if you do not have one, use a large bowl or cookie sheet.\nCut the sushisu gently into rice with the paddle, trying not to break the kernels. For Western chefs: this \"cutting\" motion is similar to the cut-and-fold used for gentle treatment of egg whites. When finished, the rice is evenly coated with the dressing, giving it a shiny appearance.\nCover the rice with a cloth for a couple of minutes so the dressing is absorbed.\nCool the rice to body temperature by fanning it, while continuing to cut it with the spatula. A traditional hand fan or modern battery-powered fan may be used.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "A rice-cooker is often used instead of a cooking pot; these generally produce good, consistent results. The manufacturer's directions will generally be similar to the above.\nThe rice and sushisu should be mixed immediately after the rice is finished cooking with sushisu at room temperature.\nSome sushi chefs prefer natural cooling, rather than fanning, and instead let the rice rest in the hangiri for 15 minutes, then re-cut the rice, and continue with this process until the rice is cool.\nAccording to some, the faster the rice cools, the better (but see above about natural cooling, which yields a slightly different texture). The rice is best if used quickly: you can use it to make sushi for a few hours; it certainly cannot be prepared a day early."

After a minute add the chopped tomatoes, the peas and carrots, and the celery. Every so often, add a little bit of the chicken broth to the pan so that it won't burn.\nAdd the chopped pickles.\nAfter all the broth has been added and the whole seems good, taste to see if it has enough salt; if not, add some. Cool slightly, then mix in the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.\nTransfer the chicken mixture to the dough-lined pan until it is nicely filled.\nSlice the boiled eggs and place them on top of the filling in the pan.\nTop the mixture with the second sheet of dough. Seal the edges as best as possible.\nPut the pastei in a preheated oven, and bake for about  3/4 hour.\nA few minutes before you take it out of the oven, you can lightly brush the top with some whisked egg to make the top shiny and a little crisp.",

Also consider picking strawberries yourself; this way you can choose the ripe and fresh ones and get the size you need for the dumplings. Moreover, you can try a few while picking. Use the spare strawberries for making jam.\nThe breadcrumbs can be toasted without sugar, but in this case you will miss on the caramel flavor. You can also roast the breadcrumbs without butter.\nThis recipe also works well with other fillings like apricots, plums, or chocolate. In Austria the dumplings are also filled with \"Mozartkugeln\", which are little balls of chocolate, nougat, and almond paste. If you use apricots or plums as a filling, you can add a pinch of cinnamon to the sugar before mixing it with the breadcrumbs. If you serve dumplings with a chocolate filling, garnish them with chocolate sauce and ground walnuts.\nIt is a good idea to serve the dumplings with ice cream (preferably vanilla flavor), garnished with fresh berries and a mint leaf.\nEnjoying a glass of cold milk together with the dumplings is especially refreshing in the summer months. In Austria it is also common to serve sweet dishes with a cup of coffee.\nCurd cheese dough only tastes well with sweet fillings. For savory dumplings, which are very popular in Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic, use potato dough and no breadcrumbs."

Check the pan is clean and scrape any bits that have stuck in the pan off and add a bit of oil if it is looking dry. Now slide the omelette back into the pan to cook the bottom.\nCook for another few minutes,\nRepeat the turning trick a couple of times (practice makes perfect) to make sure it is cooked evenly.\nTransfer to a large plate, cut into wedges, and serve with more tapas.",

        "desc": "Recipes vary, though all agree that pecorino romano, eggs, cured fatty pork, and black pepper are the basics. The pork is fried in fat (olive oil or lard). Then, a mixture of eggs, cheese and olive oil is combined with the hot pasta, thereby cooking the eggs. All of the ingredients are then mixed together.[1][2][3] Guanciale is the most traditional cured pork cut for this recipe, but pancetta is a popular substitute.[4][5] In the US, it is often made with American bacon.\n",
        "History": "Like most recipes, the origins of the dish are obscure but there are many legends. As 'carbonara' literally means 'coal miner's wife', some believe that the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian coal miners. Others say that it was originally made over charcoal grills, or that it was made with squid ink, giving it the color of coal. It has even been suggested that it was created by, or as a tribute to, the \"charcoalmen\", a secret society prominent in the unification of Italy. Also, the name may be from a Roman restaurant named Carbonara.[12][13]\nThe dish is not present in Ada Boni's 1927 classic La Cucina Romana, and is unrecorded before the Second World War. It was first recorded after the war as a Roman dish, when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by American troops.",

When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook for about 10 minutes over a low flame until the pancetta has rendered most of its fat but is still chewy and barely browned.\nIn a bowl, slowly whisk about  1/2 cup of the pasta water into the egg yolks. Add the grated cheese and mix thoroughly with a fork.\nStrain the spaghetti and transfer it immediately to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss it and turn off the heat.\nAdd the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta while stirring in the remaining pasta water to help thin the sauce and create an emulsion.\nAdd the pepper and toss all the ingredients to coat the pasta.",

        "Making your own starter": "If you cannot find a source of starter it is easy to make your own.\nKey concepts\nSeveral key concepts are needed for understanding the sourdough production process. In what follows, recipe by volume measures are probably familiar.  Measurement of the ingredients by weight, and any notation system used may be new and unfamiliar. Such notation systems are actually very simple, and it is recommended you familiarize yourself with them.\nTwo types of sourdough starter\nIn the most basic sense, there are two types of sourdough used in baking. One type is used in acid-base reactions to form leavening gas, such as sourdough quick breads or pancakes. Such doughs or more liquid batters might be combined with baking soda for the production of leavening gas. These sourdoughs may be kept in an imbalanced or unstable state of abnormally high acidity. The other type of sourdoughs are ideally kept in stable-culture states. Breads made from such starters are often associated with places like San Francisco and French sourdoughs, or German-rye sourdoughs, etc. These sourdoughs are leavened by the gas production of yeasts and lactobacilli during fermentation.\nUnstable sourdoughs can easily be created from stable ones, all that's needed is to stop refreshing it as frequently, or to refresh it with a too-high ratio of old:new flour. For both types, sufficient time is required for the organisms to initially grow, and with respect to the latter type, balance themselves into what is called a stable culture. Patience is required for creating both types, and with respect to stable cultures, more attention to details are required.\nRefreshment\nTimelapse of a newly refreshed stiff (100% hydration) rye starter culture over a 10-hour period at roughly 25degC\nRefreshment occurs when new dough is mixed with older dough. New dough is made by mixing fresh flour with water. New dough becomes older dough when it has sufficient age. New dough is essentially new food supply for the yeasts and lactobacilli existing in the older dough. That food supply comes from the flour in the dough.\nWhen older dough is mixed with new dough, any organisms in the older dough inoculate the new dough. With sufficient time the populations of organisms in the older dough increase. Over multiple refreshments, a stable culture emerges. If the objective is maintenance of a stable culture suitable for leavening bread, one which is stored or fermented at room temperatures, refreshments that occur once per day are acceptable.\nTemperature\nAccording to sourdough researcher Michael Ganzle, optimum growth for one strain of Lactobacillus sanfransicensis occurs at 32 degC (89.6 degF), and for the yeast Candida milleri, 27 degC (80.6 degF). That yeast stops growing at 35-37 degC (95-99 degF). Some enthusiasts think that starter-storage temperatures over 27 degC (80.6 degF) are too hot. At temperatures lower than that, the generation times of both organisms are increased.\nAccording to Van der Meulen, Scheirlinck, Van Schoor, et al., when starting a spontaneous starter, enterococci and lactococci establish themselves before lactobacilli, which establish themselves before the yeasts. The emergence of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria follows, and is a marker of having a stable culture. These bacteria produce CO2 leavening gas.\nThus, a tactic to speed the establishment of a stable culture may be to use optimum lactobacilli temperatures in the first 2-3 days, then slightly lower temperatures better suited to yeast growth afterward. Once a stable culture is established, the mother dough is often kept at room temperature, and sometimes is refrigerated to slow growth. Calvel cautioned against the use of storage temperatures lower than 10 degC (50 degF).\npH\nNote:\nThe pH metric (negative log of the concentration of the hydronium ion in an aqueous solution) offers a scale to measure the acidity or alkalinity of liquids. It takes a value between 0.0 and 14.0 and low pH values (tending towards zero) are acidic, 7 is neutral (the pH of pure water), and high pH values (tending towards 14) are alkaline.\nUntil bacteria and yeast populations establish themselves, the pH of the dough tends to be sweeter or more alkaline. The \"sour\" of sourdough essentially means \"acid\" dough. As new dough ages it becomes more acidic due to production of lactic and acetic acids by bacteria growing in the sourdough. Sourdough starter has preservation effects in the bread made with it, decreasing its rate of staling. The pH of a dough can be measured at anytime; however, from a dough kneader's viewpoint, a more acidic dough is stickier.\nIn his correspondence with Dan Wing, Ganzle said the optimum pH for lactobacilli is in the range of 5.0-to-5.5. The lactobacilli colonies stop growing at 3.8, they stop producing acid at 3.6. New dough has a higher pH than sourdough, so every time mother dough is refreshed with new dough, the pH is increased or made more alkaline. As the organisms' populations grow following refreshment, they produce more acid, lowering the dough's pH as time passes. The yeasts are less sensitive to acidic conditions than the lactobacilli, so by manipulating the older:new dough ratio, in cooperation with the time interval between refreshments, conditions more or less favorable for each set of organisms are created.\nTypical ingredients\nunbleached (wholegrain works best) flour\nnon-chlorinated water\nBleached flour or tap water can be used, but may give undesirable results. Bleached flour has most of the yeasts killed. Chlorine in tap water can inhibit the wild yeast that you wish to grow. For typical, artisan-style lean-dough  breads, the wheat flour used should be of a protein level suitable for bread. For quick breads, lower protein flours are commonly desired.\nFlour manufacturers may not have added barley malt or enzymes, thus diastatic malt may be a desired ingredient in the initial dough.  Diastatic malt is generally finely ground malted barley or other sprouted grain that has not been subjected to high temperatures which inactivate its enzymes. One function of the enzymes is to snip apart the starch matrix into food the organisms can consume. If the flour's ingredient label doesn't indicate enzymes or malt were added, then add powdered, diastatic malt at a rate of 0-2% of the flour weight. Calvel used 0.5% based on the flour weight in the initial dough of his primary-culture levain.\nFirm starter by weight\nThe following formula was inspired by the former Larraburu Company of San Francisco.[1] Inspiration was also provided by the works of sourdough researcher Michael Ganzle, as well as many others, found by following the links in the references section. What follows is a simple, basic process, and thus should be beneficial for beginners' understanding. There are many instructions by excellent bakers that use more complexity in their sourdough formulas, often for very good reasons. Unfortunately, those very same embellishments tend to obscure the basic process.\nBakers' percentages\nProfessional bakers measure by weight due to its higher accuracy compared to volumetric measure, even though some professionals publish volumetric recipes. Professional bakers also tend to work with larger dough amounts in commercial settings. One advantage of bakers percentages is that they may be easily scaled to larger or smaller quantities. Baker's percentages are based on flour weight, and are calculated so the flour percentage equals 100%.  However, this is not an article about how to calculate them.\nA brief review of how to use a typical formula composed of bakers' percentages:\ningredient weight = flour weight x baker percent(ingredient)/100%\nSourdough has a flour fraction, as aged as it may be, and it has a water fraction. This means the starter or older dough would need to be proportioned in order that the new flour and the old flour (in the older dough) would add up to 100%. An example of such a notation system is presented by Kulp and Lorenz in their Table 10, \"Formulas of U.S. Sourdough French Bread and Panettone Bread\".[2]\nIn the notation system of Firm starter by weight, the new flour is considered the 100% ingredient. Such a notation system is similar to the one Gisslen used in his formula for Rustic Sourdough Bread, a final dough.[3]  The starter from the prior refreshment and its flour, the old flour, is not included in the 100% new-flour value. Thus, the above formula has been altered with a minor change:\ningredient weight = new-flour weight x baker percent(ingredient)/100%\nScales or balances\nA scale of 1/10 gram readability or better is required for measuring the ingredient weights that follow. The error range of a 1 gram readability scale when measuring 5 grams is 20%.\nIf your scale reads with only 1 gram of accuracy, the weights given will need to be increased. Simply multiply the flour weights by 10 and recalculate the other weights from the bakers' percentages. You could also multiply the given weights by 10.\nInitial dough\nInitial dough1st day\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\ngrams\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n13.33\n\n\nwater\n50%\n6.67\n\n\nformula\n150%\n20\nThe bottom line's numbers are known as the formula percentage and formula weight.\nCombine 13.33 grams of flour with 6.67 grams of water in a rather small bowl, about the size of a custard cup.  Lightly mix it with a spoon until the water has just combined with all or most all of the flour. A second spoon is helpful for scraping the dough from the first spoon. Let it sit or rest for a few minutes to hydrate. Next, finish the mixing process by hand kneading it. It is too small of a dough amount for mixing machines, and it won't need much kneading. If it gets hard to knead, and the dry flour is not fully incorporated, let it rest for 15-20 minutes to relax the dough, then finish kneading it. Form it into a small dough ball. Be sure to have prepared a small jar or container half full of flour, with a slight depression in the center as viewed from above. Place the dough ball into the depression. The purpose of the flour and its depression is to keep the dough ball from rolling and contacting the container and sticking to it: it also raises it higher in the jar, easing daily access. Loosely cover the container with a lid, and ideally store it in a location with a temperature in the range of 27 to 32 degC (81 to 89.6 degF), slightly warmer than room temperature, for about 24 hours. If fermentation occurs at temperatures lower than that, the organisms' generation times are increased.\nMaintain-weight refreshments\nMother doughMaintain weightDays 2-7 (or longer)refresh every 24 hrs\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\ngrams\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n10\n\n\nwater\n50%\n5\n\n\nstarter\n50%\n5\n\n\nformula\n200%\n20\nThe flour weight equals the formula weight divided by the formula percentage: 20 g / 200% = 10 g.\nLightly mix 10 grams of flour with 5 grams of water, making 15 grams of new dough, and let it rest for at least a few minutes to hydrate. Hand knead the result, making a new-dough ball. Weigh 5 grams of starter from the total of 20 grams made the previous day, and discard the remainder. Knead the starter and new-dough ball together well, and form into a refreshed-dough ball. Place it back in the jar, and cover. Repeat this process once per day for at least 7 days. Until you have a stable sourdough and one that rises or swells reliably, continue to ferment it in the range of 27 to 32 degC (81 to 89.6 degF), refreshing once per day. Once your dough rises reliably, fermentation may occur at room temperatures.  If you don't have such a warm place, and only have room temperature available, expect the process to take a bit longer.\nPresuming you originally used a small jar half-filled with new flour, and haven't changed the flour, you will probably observe that it moistens somewhat after a few refreshments, and once a firm sourdough culture is successfully created and fermented in this flour, it will begin to develop its own set of faint odors. It is no longer fresh, new flour.\nYou may decide to change the mother dough's flour weight for various reasons. However, the ratios of the newly added fresh flour to the older flour already fermented are rather important.  This ratio is somewhat occulted in bakers' formula notation, so figure and weigh carefully.\nIncrease-weight refreshments\nMother doughIncrease weight\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\ngrams\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n40\n\n\nwater\n50%\n20\n\n\nstarter\n50%\n20\n\n\nformula\n200%\n80\nTo increase the starter weight the same abstract formula is used to determine the flour weight, but the values used are different. You'll note that in the matrix the 20 g figure occurs on an ingredient line, the starter's line instead of the formula line. To determine the flour weight, the existing starter weight from the prior fermentation is divided by the bakers' percent(starter): 20 g / 50% = 40 g. This is the maximum amount of new flour that can be used for this increase-weight refreshment given the available starter weight.\nThe formula claims you have 20 grams of starter from the prior day. However, weighing it and calculating ingredient weights based on the actual weight is a consideration due to losses, such as dough that sticks to the mixing spoon, or storage container, etc. With a small dough ball, more precision is required.\nIf you use less flour and the prior day's starter weighs 20 g, there will be some starter discard when measuring to the calculated starter weight. If more starter is needed than the formula weight of 80 g, it is best to use only 40 g of flour, let it ferment for 24 hours, then increase it once again.\nPresuming the next step's formula calls for a bakers' percent(starter) of 50%, and presuming you have no dough losses, the table above shows a formula weight of 80 g. Thus 80 g / 50% = 160 g. This means 160 g is the maximum amount of flour to use on the next increase. This increase method maintains the starter:flour ratio and the implied ratio of old:new flour.\nAfter you have increased the mother dough to sufficient weight for your final dough, it is important to weigh and reserve your mother-dough starter before adding the other portion to the final dough, otherwise you will lose your stable culture. In the formula weights calculated above, the starter weight is 5 grams, thus you need 5 grams more starter at the end of increase refreshments than the final-dough formula demands. You may also decide to maintain a different weight mother dough, particularly so your increase weight iterations synchronize better to the final starter weight needed.\nStarter amount for final dough\nThe Larraburu Company is reported to have used a baker's percent value of 15% for the final dough.[1] Let's say you have increased your original 20 g stable-culture sourdough ball to 80 g of starter (because of losses, you'll actually have a little less than that). Remember to reserve 5 g for the mother-dough ball.  80 g - 5 g = 75 g. How much bread can you make? 75 g / 15% = 500 g. This means when you have made 80 g of starter and reserved 5 g for the mother-dough ball, you already have enough starter for a final dough of 500 g new-flour weight. Any other non-flour ingredients in the final dough are irrelevant to that calculation. The formula weight of the final dough will be greater than 500 g.\nAdvanced topics: altering the formula\nOne beauty of baker's percentages is the ease with which an ingredient's values may be changed, thus making a new formula. In the mother dough formulas above, two values that may be changed are the bakers' percent(water) and bakers' percent(starter). The new flour is fixed at 100%.\nLiquid starter\nIf you desire a more liquid starter than the firm starter described above, increase the bakers' percent(water), and recalculate the ingredient weights and formula percent. More liquid starters would generally have a water value of around 100%, though it could be increased further.\nLiquid starter\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n\n\nwater\n100%\n\n\nstarter\n50%\n\n\nformula\n250%\nHowever, by only changing the water value, the old:new flour ratio is also changed.\nWhen fermenting a liquid starter, do not store it in a container filled with flour, just use a container with a suitable opening. A wide-mouthed glass jar with a loose-fitting or breathable lid works well for small amounts. Only fill the container partway full, otherwise the starter may overflow as it ferments.  How much it rises is somewhat dependent on its liquidity and other factors.\nStarter ratio\nThe other value which may be changed is the starter percentage, a value which is related to the old:new flour ratio.  With the water value fixed at 50%, starter values in excess of 100% generally result, just after refreshment, in too low of a dough pH for the lactobacilli to grow well. As that value is increased even further, the lactobacilli will be more inhibited. If you've increased the starter percentage too much, decrease it some, and refresh a few times with the new ratio.\nHigher inoculumliquid starter\n\n\ningredient\nbakers%\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n\n\nwater\n100%\n\n\nstarter\n100%\n\n\nformula\n300%\nWater and starter interrelationships\nThere are interrelationships between the water percentage and the starter percentage that are not quite as obvious. When the starter's percent is a fixed value relative to the new flour, increasing the water percentage decreases the relative amount of flour in a given weight of starter, thus changing the old:new flour ratio.  So, when the bakers' percentage(water) is changed, it will be necessary to adjust the bakers' percentage(starter) to maintain the desired ratio.\nTrue percent\nWhile baker's percentages are based on flour weight, true percentages are based on formula percentage or weight,  frequently phrased as total weight. The formula percent is the sum of the bakers' percentages.\ntrue percent(ingredient)  = baker percent(ingredient)/formula percent x 100%\nThe ratio underlying the true percent is useful for calculating various old:new ratios.\ntrue ratio(ingredient)  = baker percent(ingredient)/formula percent\nIf an ingredient's bakers' percent remains constant, the true percent decreases as formula percent increases, and the true percent increases as formula percent decreases.  When any of the other bakers' percents change, the formula percent changes.\nPuzzle\nConsider the following two formulas:\ningredient\nbakers%\nbakers%\n\n\nwheat flour\n100%\n100%\n\n\nwater\n50%\n200%\n\n\nstarter\n100%\n200%\n\n\nformula\n250%\n500%\nWhat are the old:new flour ratios?\nHighly-liquid starter by volume\nCombine 1/2 tablespoon of flour with 3 tablespoons of water and let sit overnight at room temperature. Each day add 1 tablespoon of water and one tablespoon flour and mix until the total volume is about 1 cup (240ml). The symbiotic combination of yeasts and lactobacilli can be encouraged to reproduce more easily by controlling the pH (acidity) of the mixture using pineapple juice instead of water for the first three days and maintaining a temperature of 75 degF (about 23 degC, roughly international room temperature). Make sure that you have a working starter by observing whether the dough bubbles and rises. If not, then leave exposed to the air and test again. Thereafter, dump out  1/2 cup (120ml), and mix in  1/2 cup (120ml) water and  1/2 cup (120ml) flour.\nDiscussion\nA method of decreasing the dough's pH faster, one used by The Baker's Manual author Joseph Amendola, is to have an excessively large starter percentage, based on new-flour weight, on the second and third days (first and second refreshment), roughly 214% and 433%, respectively, before dropping it back down to 66.7% on all remaining days of a 7-day-long process.\nWhen making sourdough for the purposes of acid-base leavening, such as pancakes, a more-acid dough is often desired. A simple way for a baker to achieve that using accurate measurement and formula notation is to use an excessively high starter percentage.\nGenerally, sourdough improves with age. There is a noticeable difference between a 1-week and a 1-month starter, and some can tell a difference between 1 month and 1 year. Some will claim it takes 40 years to get a good starter, though nobody waits that long to use it.\nThe sourdough method sometimes takes patience when starting anew. You may have to refresh your dough for longer than 7 days, much depends upon the flour and water used, as well as any yeasts and bacteria that exist in the environment, the starter ratio, the time between refreshments, and the temperature. There is no guarantee that you will pick up good yeasts floating in the air (there are many yeasts, but most will not make for good bread). The only way to tell is to wait until you get a critical mass of yeasts and see if it makes good bread. Generally, bad yeasts will smell strange; and so too will starter that uses too high of a starter:flour ratio, and thus is too acid for the lactobacilli to grow. Your starter should always smell clean, perhaps with undertones of alcohol and a sharp touch of acid if it is getting old.\nThere are other methods that are more likely to succeed, but you may lose the locality effect. Take some organic grapes. Wash them to knock off any dust or dirt, and immerse them in a bowl of potable water for 2 minutes. Remove the grapes from the water, which now contains the yeast that was growing on the outside of the grapes. If the grapes are local, then you have a local starter. Use this water to mix with the flour to make a dough, place in a small cup, cover and wait. If the dough rises, then you have a working starter.\nA third method is to use a little kefir to initiate the sourdough starter. As with grapes, you will not get the effect of using a localised starter, but it is a reliable and effective method. Give it a stir every eight hours or so. It should be very active within 3 hours, possibly as few as 2.\nMixing 100 g flour with 100 g buttermilk or natural yogurt, plus 15 g water is also very effective for beginning a sourdough starter. This usually takes about 72 hours at room temperature to get going.\nOr if you really want to cheat, you can mix flour with water to a desired hydration ratio and add a pinch of shop bought yeast. This should be left for 48 hrs at room temperature before using. You won't get the same natural taste initially, but the local yeasts in the air and in your flour will take over in time.\nKeeping starter\nSourdough starter is alive, and thus it must be regularly refreshed. Exactly how often this should be done depends on storage temperatures and the local strain. An active starter should be fed daily, if not multiple times per day depending on temperature, starter ratio, and other conditions. See the note below about dormant starters.\nSourdough is best stored at room temperature or slightly warmer. Anything outside of this range will change the proportions of the bacteria and yeast, which affects the flavor of the baked product.\nStarter can be safely stored in the fridge, and if so, let it sit out several hours after feeding before returning it to the fridge. This allows the yeasts to get active and feed. Longer than this and your starter will begin to smell boozy and have a sharper tang to it than you might want. To fix this, just discard 90% and start the feeding cycle again.\nAccording to Amendola, starter stored in the refrigerator needs refreshment only once per week. When removed for use, it requires two refreshments at room temperature to recover before adding to a final dough.\nLong-term storage can be done by drying some starter, causing the yeast to go dormant. A thin layer of liquid starter spread on glass or ceramic plate speeds drying. If you have access to a vacuum dryer, that's even better. Exactly how long yeast can be stored this way varies, but it is enough for trading starters.\nFreezing the dried-out starter allows it to be stored for over a year. Just dry the starter out, place it into a sealed jar and put it in the freezer. If you need it again, take one part of frozen starter, crush it, and mix it with one part of fresh flour. Add water and it should get active in a few hours.\nIf you do not bake daily, then your starter will go dormant as the yeasts shut down from hunger. You may see a separation occur in the starter vessel, where a yellowish clear liquid rises to the top and the white doughy starter falls to the bottom.  The liquid is rich in yeast metabolic by-products. You can mix it back in when you feed, but it sharpens the finished bread flavor to a degree that you may find distasteful. Simply throw out the liquid before feeding. But you should note that once your starter has gone dormant, you must re-invigorate by multiple feedings to get it back to a healthful vigor (see below).\nUsing starter\nUsing starter is easy, just take out the amount you need, and then increase the starter to replenish your supply. Avoid using all the starter on hand, though if you must, enough will cling to the sides of the pot to get the starter going again.\nIf using starter often you should keep your batches large enough so that enough is on hand. If you rarely use your starter you should keep just a small amount on hand, and increase it before it's needed.\nYou need to make sure that your starter is full strength before committing it to a dough. That means that it should quadruple if fed and left for an hour. If not, then it needs to be fed. Accelerate your feeding schedule until it passes the above test.\nIncreasing\nMany recipes call for more starter than is kept on hand. Starter is easily increased. At its most basic level, simply add more new dough and let it ferment for a day. However, the amount of new dough added affects the pH, this change in pH in turn affects the culture. If not enough new dough is added, it may not raise the pH sufficiently to insure vigorous lactobacilli growth. If too much new dough is added, the amount of inoculum is reduced, and according to Karel Kulp and Klaus Lorenz, starter values less than 20% of total weight correlate to less stable cultures. In either case, a previously stable culture can become unstable, requiring multiple refreshments and fermentation intervals to restabilize. A formula for increasing starter precisely to a stipulated ratio is covered in the by weight sections.",

Shortbread is so named because of its crumbly texture (from an old meaning of the word short).  The cause of this texture is its high fat content, provided by the butter.  The related word \"shortening\" refers to any fat that may be added to produce a short (crumbly) texture.[1]\n",

        "desc": "Cottage pie (beef), or shepherd's pie (lamb), is an Irish meat pie with a mashed potato top. It is traditionally made with leftover roast meat, but today it is more often made with fresh minced meat.\n",
        "Ingredients": "30 g (1 oz) lard (optional)\n1 lb (450 g) minced or ground lamb or beef\n3 lb (1.3 kg) powdery old potatoes, such as King Edwards\n1 large or 2 small onions\n2 tbsp flour\n2 cups (300 ml) beef stock (alternatively, bouillon cubes can be used, or gravy powder, if the flour is omitted)\nCheese, grated (optional)\n1 handful of mixed vegetables such as sweetcorn or carrots (optional)\nMixed herbs\nMilk\nButter",
        "Procedure": "Heat oil in a pan and brown the lamb mince. Where lean meat is used, there may be no need to use additional oil.\nFinely chop the onion and lightly fry in a little butter with a small amount of salt until clear.\nAdd the onions to the mince, mixed herbs, and some pepper.\nSprinkle the flour over the mixture, stir, and cook for 3-4 minutes (if using gravy powder, omit this step).\nCover with lamb or beef stock (or add water and beef bouillon/gravy powder) and simmer for 30 minutes.\nTest the savoury mince for seasoning. If gravy is not used, additional salt may be needed.\nMeanwhile:\nPeel, chop and boil the potatoes for 20 minutes until cooked.\nOnce the meat is cooked, skim off the excess fat, then reduce the savoury mince until the liquid is level with the mince and onions.\nDrain the potatoes until completely dry. Mash until smooth and free of any lumps.\nAdd butter to the mashed potato, taste and add seasoning as required.\nSlowly add milk whilst mashing until the mash is soft and creamy (heavy mash will not float properly on top of the mince).\nPut mince mixture in a shallow oven-proof dish.\nLayer the mash over the meat and brush the tops of the potatoes with melted butter.\nIf desired, sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the mash.\nIf cooking without cheese, rough up the surface of the mash by dragging a fork across it, as if ploughing a field.\nBake in a hot oven for about 30-50 minutes until the top is golden brown.\nServe with peas or beans, or other green vegetables.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The etymology of the name Shepherd's Pie is related to the shepherding of lambs, whereas Cottage Pie was used to describe the dish made with beef--a cheaper meat that was eaten by the poor who lived in cottages. The terms are often used interchangeably, regardless of meat, though most cookbooks will refer to \"shepherd's pie\" if made with lamb, and \"cottage pie\" if made with beef, or highlight the possible variations within a single recipe.\nAdding the butter and milk to the potatoes before they are properly mashed is the best way to make lumpy mash.\nRoughing up the surface of the mash makes the top crispier, by increasing the surface area and providing thin sections which dry out and crisp faster; compare roast potatoes.\nFrying the meat in lard can improve the texture and consistency of the finished product, although this also has the effect of increasing drastically the saturated fat content.\nAs with many dishes based on minced meat, the mince can be cooked for much longer in the stock than specified, up to two hours. Some cooks prefer this as it gives longer for the flavour to develop. People often comment that shepherd's pie tastes better when reheated the day after for this reason! A quicker alternative is to add a splash of Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce or Cookbook:Soy Sauce, both of which act as flavour enhancers.\nFor cottage pie, peas or small chopped carrots are often integrated into the mince during the reduction step.",

In 1691 it first appeared in a German cookbook under the name Guldene Schnitten (golden slices). The term Armer Ritter (poor knight) was first used in 1787 and had its breakthrough in the 19th century.\n",
        "Ingredients": "17.5 oz (500 g) stale white bread\n2 apples\n2 peaches\n4 tbsp (60 g) refined sugar\n1 pinch ground cinnamon\n2 cups ( 1/2 L) milk\n4 eggs\n4 tsp (20 ml) rum or a few drops of rum aroma\n1 tbsp butter",

Then take the slices of bread and let them soak in the mixture for a few seconds. This will take longer if you use stale rather than fresh bread.\nMix the refined sugar and the cinnamon in a cup or a small bowl.\nGrease an ovenproof dish, then layer the slices, bread, and fruit alternately in the dish.

        "Notes, tips, and variations": "This recipe is rather a guideline; you can alter it according to your taste and wishes. Generally, there is not only one recipe for Scheiterhaufen, as people in former times were forced to use what they had available.\nYou can take any kind of white bread you like, stale or fresh. You can use any kind of white bread that you have on-hand, but for an extra soft Scheiterhaufen, something like the white bread used for toast yields the best result. One variation is to roast the bread in a pan with a bit of butter before layering it (in this case you would have to pour the milk-egg-rum mixture on top of your layers).\nYou can use other kinds of fruit to suit your taste, but the traditional Austrian Scheiterhaufen recipe uses only apples. Plums are also a good choice, but frankly, you can use any fruit of the season. The selection above is a summer variation.\nSome cooks like to add nuts like almonds or hazelnuts to create a distinctive taste. You can also add raisins; they are often used together with apples in Austrian cuisine."

        "desc": "Sauerkraut is a traditional fermented vegetable food made from cabbage. This basic recipe produces a tangy sauerkraut with live bacteria. No cooking is required.\n",
        "Ingredients": "1 large (2.5 kg / 5 lb) fresh cabbage\n2-3 tablespoons non-iodised salt",
        "Procedure": "Clean and dry a large (3 litres) preserves jar or crock, chopping board, and large bowls if needed.\nQuarter the cabbage and remove the core.\nSlice the cabbage finely or thickly, as you prefer.\nIf desired, bruise the sliced cabbage by beating with a rolling pin or mortar and pestle.\nLayer the cabbage in the jar or crock, sprinkling salt in between the layers.\nPack tightly into the jar, leaving 1 cm space at the top; don't seal the jar yet.\nJuice should rise to top of jar as you tightly pack the cabbage in; if not, add a little chlorine-free water.\nCover the jar with a clean cloth or cling-wrap. Set the jar in a bowl or on a plate, so that any juice that might overflow will be collected and won't make a mess. Don't seal the jar while it is fermenting, as it will build up gas pressure and might break the jar.\nEvery morning and evening, insert a narrow long object into the jar to let the air out, then collect the juice from the plate and re-add it to the jar. Ensure the temperature is kept constant during the fermentation--otherwise the fermentation may not proceed correctly, and the wrong bacteria may grow. If you don't heat your kitchen in winter then you will need to store the jar in your bedroom or another area with a steadier temperature throughout day and night.\nThe sauerkraut will be fermented in three days to about a week. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to a cool place (e.g. the refrigerator) to mature. It is ready to eat after the first week, but it will improve with age as the bacteria slowly consume the more complex sugars in the cabbage.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The salt used should be non-iodised, since iodine can slightly inhibit the fermentation. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the iodine.\nAdd other vegetables, fruits, or spices such as juniper berries, cored and sliced apple, diced pineapple, onion, chili, or grated carrot.\nThe cabbage can be quickly sliced to a regular thickness by using a mandoline.",

Make sure to wash your hands right after cutting the chilis, and DO NOT touch your eyes or face for some time after handling the chilis--if you do, the chili juice residue could cause a very painful burning sensation.)\nPeel and chop the onion and garlic finely.

Sit the jar in a bowl or on a plate, so that any juice that might overflow will be collected and won't make a mess. Leave to ferment at room temperature.\nThe salsa will be fermented in 2-3 days, depending on the climate. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to the refrigerator. It will last well in the fridge, but will continue to slowly ferment, getting more sour as time passes.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "With the above fresh ingredients, there should be enough microbial load for the salsa to start fermenting by itself. Bubbles will begin rising to the top of the jar, showing that fermentation is under way--you should be able to see this through the side of the jar. Don't seal the jar while it is fermenting, as it will build up gas pressure and might break the jar. If you are concerned that fermentation will not start by itself, you can add a starter culture. A good starter culture is a little juice from a recently-fermented sauerkraut or kimchi, as this will bring across the necessary lactic acid bacteria and yeasts.\nThis is best within a few days, unless you like it quite sour!\nThe salt used should be non-iodised salt if possible (e.g. pickling salt, kosher salt). This is because the iodine in iodised table salt will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the iodine.\nUse fresh ingredients where possible; if you do use canned or dried ingredients, you may need to use a starter (see above).\nThis recipe prefers to ferment at a temperature between 18-22degC (64-72degF). It will happily ferment outside that range, but if you want to keep it in that range, there are some tips available on the fermentation page.\nThere is a suggestion on the talk page that more salt is required; read the discussion and decide for yourself, but traditional French recipes add no salt during the fermentation of crushed tomatoes. Salt volume recommendations made without specifying brand (and therefore grain size and shape) are not precise in any case.",

Do not accidentally get any fat (from the egg yolks, butter, or chocolate) in the egg white mix or it will not foam properly.\nDo not allow flour lumps in the mix, because lumps of white flour show up badly in this brown cake.\nTo get the traditional perfectly cylindrical shape, trim the cake body into a circle with vertical edges, and cut the top off flat before glazing.\nAdding alcohol to the cake is not a good idea. It is already very moist, and more liquid will make it soggy.\nDon't use white chocolate in the cake body because it is fairly unnoticeable in flavour and colour, leaving only the moistening effect.\nDon't use self-raising flour, which creates large bubbles in the cake.\nIf carried out in the order above, no tool should need to be washed up more than once.\nThere are several other recipes for Sachertorte--some use even more eggs in the cake and egg and cream in the glaze.",

        "Procedure": "Outdoors\nBuild a campfire for toasting the marshmallows.\nFind a long, thin stick for roasting (a thin, long wooden dowel may be a good substitute but will catch fire easily). The stick, which is usually taken from the ground as part of a dead tree branch, does not have to be sterilized, but simply clear of any dirt or bark. Alternately, you may purchase a metal roaster stick. Don't use a coat hanger or chrome or galvanized metal (like fence wire)--use stainless steel.\nBefore roasting the marshmallows, break the crackers in half, so you have two 2 x 2 inch (5 x 5 cm) squares for each s'more. Break the chocolate bar into  1/2 oz (15 g) pieces.\nPush a marshmallow on to the end of the stick. Using the stick to place the marshmallow directly above the flame or source of heat, toast the marshmallow until it is golden brown around the outside. Some prefer their marshmallow burned. Others like to burn the marshmallow and peel off the burned outer skin to get to the gooey center.\nPlace the toasted marshmallow in between two pieces of graham cracker, with a layer of chocolate bar in between. The marshmallow should be hot enough to melt the chocolate. In a family setting, sometimes it is helpful for children to roast the marshmallows, and adults to supervise and assemble the s'more while preventing the child from touching the hot end of the stick. Enjoy!\nIndoors\nPrepare the pieces of graham cracker and chocolate as above.\nPlace the chocolate on one of the pieces of graham cracker, and then place a marshmallow on top.\nPut it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds (depending on the microwave).\nAfter it has been microwaved, the marshmallow should be much bigger, fluffier, and molten, and the chocolate should be semi-melted.
