These bread dumplings are often served alongside roast duck, goose, and pork, as well as many different kinds of dishes with hearty sauces such as Hungarian goulash and venison or mushroom ragout. The exact ingredients in the knodel vary slightly according to region and to season. Many cooks include wild garlic in the spring and in leeks in the autumn and winter. The version below is a seasonal standard.\n",
        "Ingredients": "8.8 oz (250 g) stale French or Italian bread, cut into crouton-sized cubes\n2 eggs\n1 1/4 cups (300 ml) milk (preferably whole milk)\n4 Tbsp (60 g) butter\n 1/4 cup (60 g) finely-chopped onion (1 medium-sized onion)\n2 tsp (1 large dash) salt\n 1/2-1 bunch chopped broad-leaf parsley",
        "Procedure": "Mixing the ingredients\nMix the milk, eggs and salt together. Combine the mixture with the bread cubes and the parsley in a large mixing bowl, coating as much of the bread as possible with the mixture. Let the mixture rest.\nChop and saute the onions. Cool enough to not cook the eggs, add them to the bread mixture, and mix thoroughly.\nLet the mixture rest for an hour, mixing it through once or twice during the hour. The object here is to coat the cubes with the liquid mixture on all sides to allow them to absorb as much liquid as possible; this is especially necessary if your bread is more than a few days old.\nWet a fresh cotton dishcloth, tea towel, or cloth napkin. Some cooks brush the top side of the cloth with melted butter for more flavor, but this is not necessary. Completely unfold the dishcloth and place the bread mass in the middle of the cloth.\nNext, form the bread mass into a 3-inch (~6 cm) thick log. Roll bread log up tightly in the cloth and tie off the ends of cloth with a short length of string or twine. Some cooks also tie a string around the middle as the edge of the cloth tends to pucker in the middle.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil, and then add salt. Slowly lower the serviettenknodel into the water and let cook for 40 minutes.\nRemove the serviettenknodel from the boiling water with tongs (or two forks in a pinch) and transfer to a large cutting board. Cut and remove the string; then unroll and remove the cloth.\nTo prepare the knodel for the table, begin at one end and cut  1/2-inch (1 cm) slices, taking only as many as you need in servings so that the knodel does not get cold.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "The amount of butter can also be lessened or substituted with a neutral-tasting oil.\nA wooden cutting board is preferred, as the wood will absorb much of the excess water in the cloth."

Add the sesame seeds and shake or stir. They are done when they just begin to darken and give off a pleasant toasted aroma. Be careful not to leave unattended as they can easily burn.\nRemove asparagus from steamer, shake to drain water, and arrange on serving plate.\nDrizzle the soy sauce and the sesame oil over the asparagus.\nSprinkle with the sesame seeds, and give a very light sprinkle with the Kosher salt.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "One way to gauge the best place to cut an asparagus spear is to gently grasp each end and bend the spear.  The point at which is begins to break is where the stem begins to become tougher.\nGomasio is a Japanese seasoning made with sesame seeds and salt. I obtain mine at a local health food store.

For better texture, sift the dry ingredients together with a sieve or sifter.\nAdd the eggs, milk, vanilla, and vegetable oil, and mix well.

The cake will need to be refrigerated to harden the fudge, so don't worry about its relatively liquid nature.\nRefrigerate cake.\nServe warm after refrigeration. To serve, slice a piece and microwave it for about 20 seconds. It is heavenly as the fudge melts and soaks into the cake. Serve with ice cream if you so desire.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Higher quality chocolate and baking cocoa will make a HUGE difference in this cake. It is very worth the extra expense.\nA hot fudge sauce to go over top of the cake is a nice extra touch.\nDon't try and substitute unsweetened chocolate for the dark chocolate.\nSpices such as cinnamon can be added to the frosting if desired."

Make sure the rice doesn't get too soft. Check the rice again every 10 minutes and reduce the heat slightly after each taste. Your goal is to wind up with rice that has a slightly underdone center. The time it takes to reach this point can vary from 30 minutes to an hour depending on your cooking gear.\nYour paella is done once you've accomplished the following three things: 1) The rice should be slightly firm to the bite. Italians use the same approach when cooking pasta. They call this texture al dente, 2) The paella should be a little moist but not soupy, 3) You should have a bit of toasted rice on the bottom of the paellera. This is considered a delicacy throughout the Spanish-speaking world.\nRemove the paellera from the heat and cover it with a white towel (NOT ALUMINUM FOIL).

This mixture can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for several days if necessary.\nApples\nPeel and core the apples.\nCut the apples into quarters, then cut each quarter into thin slices. You will need enough slices to make a single layer over the top of the cake.\nSet aside. As the apples will be covered by streusel topping, it doesn't matter if they turn a little brown while you make the cake batter.\nCake\nBeat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

Do not grease or flour the cake pan.\nSpread the cake batter into the prepared pan.\nArrange a single layer of apple slices on top of the cake batter. Apples should cover the cake batter as much as possible, out to the edges of the pan. If you have enough apple slices and you want more apple in your cake, then it's okay to overlap them a little.\nSprinkle the streusel mixture on top of the apples. It should generously cover all of the apples.\nBake at 350 degF (190 degC) for about 40 minutes, until the apples are soft, the cake is cooked through, and the streusel is golden brown.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Crisp apples, such as Braeburns, sweet Royal Galas, tart Granny Smiths, Honeycrisps, or tangy Newtown Pippins, are generally better for baking than mealy apples, such as Red Delicious. You can use a mix of apple types.\nYou can use gluten-free flour substitutes.\nAvoid high-gluten bread flours.\nUp to 25% of the flour in the cake batter can be replaced by almond flour or another finely ground nut flour.\nUp to half of the white granulated sugar in the cake batter can be replaced by sugar substitutes. The same volume of brown sugar can be used instead of white sugar in the streusel mixture; this will change the overall flavor slightly.\nThis recipe can be cut in half or in thirds to make a smaller cake.  A half-recipe can be baked in a 9x13 cake pan; a third-recipe can be baked in a 9x9 square cake pan."

        "desc": "Apple crisp is a dessert made up of a baked apple filling and a crispy crumb topping. It is similar to cobbler, which has a biscuit-like (USA biscuit that is) or cake-like topping. It is also similar to a crumble, and the terms 'crisp' and 'crumble' may occasionally be used interchangeably. According to some traditions, crisp toppings are more likely to contain oats and/or nuts, while crumbles typically do not contain these ingredients. Cool room temperature is required to create a nice crisp topping. To serve apple crisp, spoon it into a bowl and, optionally, add vanilla ice cream. It also goes well with a glass of milk.\n",
        "Ingredients": "6 cups sliced and cored baking apples (for example, Granny Smith)\n 1/2 cup (100 g) all-purpose flour\n 1/2 cup (100 g) rolled oats\n 3/4 teaspoon (3 g) cinnamon\n 1/3  cup (75 g) cold butter or cold margarine\n 2/3 - 3/4 cup (120-150 g) brown sugar",
        "Procedure": "In a medium bowl stir together flour, brown sugar, and oatmeal. If the room temperature is a bit warm, you should cool this mixture in the fridge.\nPrepare the apples. This should be completed before mixing butter into the topping. It is helpful to choose apples that do not brown quickly; Granny Smith apples are a good choice. Do not use Red Delicious apples; they turn to mush. Place the apples into a 9-inch (23 cm) square baking dish; glass is best.\nAdd the butter or margarine to the topping. Mix it via a slicing action, so that the butter or margarine forms tiny little chunks and does not melt or smear. A pair of butter knives, used like scissors, is good for this. You must work quickly once you start this step.\nSprinkle the topping onto the apples. You may pat it down just a bit.\nBake for about 30 minutes in a 375 degF (190degC) oven. Do not remove the crisp before the top is dark brown. Black spots indicate burning. It is better to burn a few small spots, which you can then remove, than to risk undercooking the topping.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Any type of apple may be used, baking or sweet, or a mixture of types.\nCooked apple dishes are a good use for substandard apples, e.g. damaged, wrinkled & windfall.\nCrisps can be made with most any sort of fruit. Pineapple is a good choice.\nSome fruits, especially peaches, go better in a cobbler.\nRaisins can be added to the apples at the beginning, and  1/2 teaspoon of powdered ginger, or a sprinkling of nutmeg can also be put in.\nMixed spice is a perfect addition to apple dishes. This is more popular in Britain than the US."

Make sure they are covered completely underneath at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. This is called sprouting or steeping. Leave them in the refrigerator overnight, and then drain the water. Absolutely do not drink this water, since it has absorbed many of the toxins.\nPut the 1 1/8  cups of almonds from the previous step into a blender and add 3 3/8  cups (796 ml) of fresh water. Begin blending. The mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can either strain it through a fine sieve by squeezing the milk from the moist mixture through the sieve with a wooden spoon, or simply place mesh sometimes called a sprout or nut-milk bag that is usually made of nylon on top of the pitcher in order to squeeze the mixture through the mesh by hand. You may either discard the pulp or use it for other recipes, such as mixing it into almond agar jelly. Wash and dry your hands, and then pour the almond milk into ice cube trays. Place the ice cube trays into the freezer and remove when frozen.\nPut the rest of the almonds and cowitch with 3 cups (708 ml) of fresh water into the blender. Begin blending. Just like before, this mixture will start clear and quickly change color. Stop blending after a few minutes when there is no visible change in color or consistency anymore. Wash and dry your hands, and strain this mixture over a pitcher. You can in the same way as you did in the previous step. Discard the pulp, and absolutely do not eat it, since it has many toxins. Do not drink or taste the liquid at this point. Wash and dry your hands, and put this liquid back in the blender. Blend in the dates, matcha, and milk thistle. If you are only going to make part of the mixture now, refrigerate what you're not going to use and save for later in the refrigerator.\nWhen well blended, pulse the liquid mixture with ice made from the almond milk until you reach the consistency you desire. Serve immediately.",
        "Notes, tips, and variations": "Instead of making raw almond milk from scratch, you could simply purchase almond milk or use cow's milk.
